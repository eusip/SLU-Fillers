Hi, my name is Jordan and I'm gonna be reviewing the movie Napoleon Dynamite, and this movie was really, really, really funny.   A lot of people  they didn't think it was very funny. It's really a kind of cult classic kind of movie.  You'll only like it if you're into kid of strange, bizarre humor.  Things that   you usually wouldn't find funny were in this movie.   It's basically about  a guy who's really a geek, a big geek and  he tries to get his Mexican friend to   to run for class president and that's basically the premise of the movie. There there  isn't much of a plot it's mostly just humorous situations and I spent most of the movie laughing, I thought it was really funny.  However, a lot of my friends, a lot people I know thought the movie was completely stupid and a waste of time. So it really depends on your humor. I find random stuff and things like that funny. So if you find random things and ,  you know, stuff like that funny then I would definitely pick this up. But if not, I'd stay away.	6.403
Hi, I am doing my video premium for Wolf's Rain - Recollections.   This is the fourth DVD in the series i'm xxx but completely unnecessary. It contains four episodes and each episode is   it focuses on one of the four main characters retelling what's happen so far in the story from their perspectives.   The  video, the animation in the episode most of like most like  almost all if not all is rehashed in this animation is just  taken out from the previous episodes  so they didn't even make the original animations  because they are retelling the story that's already happened so they are just reusing all that animation.   The audio is new but it doesn't tell you very much. It's just    pretty obvious stuff you know. They're basically saying this happened and this happened. It seems like they made this DVD just to   fill a gap  during the time where they couldn't make new episodes I guess   I don't know but it's  pretty upsetting but this DVD costs the same price as all the other DVDs in this series   when it has nothing new.   So, if you're a die hard fan and you wanna xxx and if you just want to watch everything in Wolf's Rain Wolf's Rain    then you can get it but I wouldn't recommend it. It's    you know just get three then go on to five.   You'll get all the story and you won't waste an hour and twenty minutes   or your money watching    what you already paid for and watched before   so I give it two out of five stars because it is Wolf's Rain but just all a rehash.	5.354
Hey, you all. How's it going? My name is Jordan, and I'm going to be reviewing a movie today. And that movie is called Crank.   Now  I don't know about you all, but I have seen tons and tons of advertisements for this movie. And when I saw the advertisements, it looked like a really action-packed kind of  suspenseful movie that I thought I was really going to enjoy. However, I got into the theater, and I started watching the movie and everything, and everything was extremely cheesy.   Basically, it's about this guy who gets injected with this kind of serum or something that makes it so he cannot let his heartbeat drop below a certain rate and, or he'll die.   So, basically, the entire movie, he's trying to keep his heartbeat up while trying to, you know, get back at the people who did this to him, say goodbye to his girlfriend, you know, tell the people that he, that he knows that he's dying and things like that.   But  a lot of the movie didn't really make sense. There was a lot of plot holes. I wouldn't really recommend it if you're kind of  if you like to think about things and, you know, if if  you're looking for just sheer blow-up stuff and, you know, things going fast and things blowing up, then I would definitely recommend seeing this movie. However, if you're looking for a sophisticated action movie that make sense, then I would not recommend this.   The acting is only so-so. I didn't really care for the main actor. I never really cared for any of his movies. They all seem the same to me.  But  but  overall, I was not very happy with this movie. I would not recommend it for people to go out and see it. I kind of wish I wouldn't have seen it, because the previews were better than the actual movie. The previews showed the best parts of the movie. The previews showed the biggest action part of the movie. And so  I wouldn't really recommend it.  So if you're looking for a good action movie, try to go see something else because this one is just not worth it. So definitely stay away from Crank. But  that sounds kind of funny, but the movie, stay away from Crank, the movie.    Yeah, but that's it.	5.354
Today I'll be reviewing   Saving Private Ryan DVD.    Saving Private Ryan is a very good movie starring Tom Hanks.   It's about   four brothers all with the last name Ryan who are in World War Two,   and three of them die and   the last one   has to   be saved because of  U.S. law.   The last remaining brother has to carry on the name.   And   Tom Hanks after the successful,   the D-Day mission   has to travel all across Europe with   his own    small batallion of  soldiers.   And has to rescue   the last brother.   And    The very good movie teaches you a lot about   history and about the soldiers and what they went through during World War Two.   It's  one of my favorite movies   and    it's won five Academy Awards.      It's overall it's just a very good movie   and   this has been my review for Saving Private Ryan DVD.	2.517
Alright, the film I'm reviewing right here is a Paramount  movie.  It's  Jackass The Movie, Special Collectors Edition.   This is a great movie.   I think this is one of the funniest movies I've probably seen in a   long time.   I dunno, it's a compilation of a whole bunch of stupid stunts by   the MTV gang, Johnny Knoxville, Steve O, and all those guys.   It's really funny.   It's really stupid, so you have to have an open mind because there's a lot   of male nudity and  just absolutely retarded stuff so.   I'd say it's really good, and you should see it only if you have a   very like, you're not squeamish or anything like that, so yeah.  I put that warning out there, not for younger kids.   This is R rated and  a lot lot of crazy stuff that your kids will   try to do if you don't yeah so don't let them see this at all.  But  yeah for me hilarious, funny.   Watch it with the guys.   Watch it with anybody.   It's hilarious, good college film.   So Jackass The Movie, Special Collectors Edition, five out of five.	4.726
This is the Garfield: Holiday Celebration DVD.  I absolutely love the Garfield Christmas. I watch it every year and I taped it and I have it on VHS and I taped it to DVD, taped out the commercials and stuff. So when I saw I could actually purchase the DVD, I jumped on it.   And it also includes the Garfield Halloween adventure and Garfield Thanksgiving and then of course the Garfield Christmas.  What I like about it is that it is one DVD, that is it. You can have all three on one. It's perfect. There, I think what, twenty-two or twenty-three minutes long because they were, you know, on television.   I love it. I've watched it every year with my daughter. Through the    Halloween and then Thanksgiving. For the Halloween one you know they go on their little adventure where they're chased by ghost pirates. And for Thanksgiving you know John's trying to cook the turkey in the dinner. And then the Christmas one, which is my all time favorite, they go to the farm. They see the the  parents, and the brother and the grandmother and I'm just a sucker for Garfield.  So  highly recommend it. It is the three hilarious Garfield Holiday DVD special and it's on DVD.	4.435
Corbitt here reviewing the movie out in theaters currently called Borat.  Borat is rated R and it's  starring a actor named Boren Sacha Cohen. He actually got his popularity on his show on HBO called Da Ali G show and basically what he does is he impersonates three characters, one of them being Borat, a person from another country who comes to America to supposedly  learn about it. What he does is he basically gets into weird situations and   he acts like a foreigner basically who's not very smart or very intelligent compared to the US people.  That's really all I'm gonna say cause I don't wanna spoil the movie. But let's just say he gets in some pretty sticky situations and   the thing about the movie is it's all pretty much reality.   It's hard to tell which ones are staged and which ones are actually reality out in the open.   But it's a great movie, it'll have you think about that. It's pretty  racist and sexist and all that kind of things but if you're willing to look past that, you're looking to see a great movie. Check it out, Borat.	4.243
This is my movie review of the Clockwork Orange, filmed in nineteen-seventy-one  by Stanley Kubrick, and he based it on the novel of Anthony Burgess. It is the most messed up movie.  It has so many extraordinary visual images, music, words, feelings  those who have watched it will also agree that you will never,  ever feel the same about Singing in the Rain, that song, that delightful tap dancing song, Fred Astaire, you will never hear that in the same way again.  Essentially it's about the future, this punk who goes out and he's a punk. He beats people up, he  does all sorts of horrible things to them and once he's found, captured, they try to reform him by  doing kind of, almost torturing him to try to get him to be more of a good person and  it is just such a fascinatingly weird movie, and if you haven't seen the Clockwork Clockwork  Orange I would recommend it. It's about two hours long, it's definitely rated R, do not have your children in the room when you watch this.  This is my review on Clockwork Orange.	5.0
This is Anne of Green Gables The Sequel   featuring Megan Follows and Colleen Dewhurst. It is the followup to Anne of Green Gables.   It is very long. It runs about four hours because it was made for television.   This is kind of hard to find. I purchased it on Amazon, and it was almost like four months to get to me. But it is a wonderful movie. Even Anne of Green Gables, if you have not seen these I would highly recommend them. They're filmed in Prince Edward Island, Canada.   The scenery alone is gorgeous.    the sequel follows Anne who goes to a teaching school   to be a teacher. And it's a private school for girls.   And just the the  hilarity that happens with her and the new girls that are in her class. And of course,    her love affair with Gilbert Blythe. It is such a romantic movie. It is rated, probably, G just because it's it's , you can watch it with the whole family. When my daughter's a little bit older, I will definitely watch this with her.   This is such a fantastic movie and it's so heartwarming. And this is my version  review of Anne of Green Gables The Sequel.	6.055
Hi, I'm going to review for you today the movie Borat: Cultural Learnings of America to Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.   This is really a hilarious movie, if you've ever seen any of Cohen's stuff. He does Ali G and Borat's like a recurring character,   and he's just like a brilliant guy who does most of his jokes like on the spot,  not scripted at all.   But this movie kind of has a little bit of a plot but   a lot of stuff is really great because he interviews people who don't really know what's going on, or who he is and it's hilarious and I highly recommend it if you like this kind of humor at all, cause it just really, it shows off a lot of America and   just cultural differences and it's really hilarious. I recommend it.	5.745
Few bands are more prolific in their output than  Dream Theater is, especially in that genre of progressive metal, and a few years ago they came out  this little DVD set,  Dream Theater: Live at Budokan. This is when I was , this came out when I was just starting to like really get into the band and this pretty much pushed me over the edge  cause  this is like a three hour concert on a single DVD and   it's just like out of this world. This is when I first really came to appreciate the virtuosity of  each member, because you know hearing it's one thing actually seeing John Petrucci's fingers fly across the  fretboard effortlessly, Mike Portnoy take on that giant  drum kit, and Jordan Rudess go crazy on keys and of course John Myung on bass. But like it just, the visual element, even though they're not like real crazy players jumping around and everything, just like seeing that playing really  captured it for me. It's  beautifully shot, and  the sound quality's very good if you remember to put it on the stereo setting if you don't have a Dolby five-point-one setup.  Cause when I first got it, I I  like it's set on default Dolby five-point-one but I didn't have that, and every time it came to a John Petrucci guitar solo all you could hear is like {guitar sounds}, like you couldn't actually hear it so that was kind of a let down, and made me dislike the DVD until I figured that out.   But , yeah, Live at Budokan, this is  a good show, the only problem is the set list isn't that great because Mike Portnoy is a  probably the best fan oriented musician  in the entire planet and he   makes sure that on the live releases they don't repeat too many songs because then, you know, you'll feel like you're gypped if half the songs on the DVD have already been on another one. The problem is they used a lot of really great songs on the one that came out before this, Live Scenes from New York, which was you know the entire scenes from Memory album  and  some more of their classics like Learning to Live. So   of like the three big live DVD releases, Live Scenes from New York, this, and Score this might have the weakest set list, but still the performances are great,  it's beautifully shot, even better shot than Score in my opinion, and   if you like Dream Theater or you're just getting into Dream Theater I think this is a DVD you should pick up.	5.802
I'm reviewing Shallow Hal, starring , Gwenyth Paltrow and Jack Black.     This movie is rated PG thirteen.  It's a pretty funny movie.    , It is about,  Shallow Hall who ,  is exactly what it's called, shallow.    He goes around to dance clubs trying to, dance with the  hot girls and all that kind of stuff ,    He then meets I believe it's Tony Robbins    in an elevator who   then kind of makes him see  the beauty within.    , So every person that he sees, he sees what they are inside.   So he ends up meeting Gwenyth Paltrow who is a heavy set woman.   But he see's the inside which is a beautiful person.   So he goes around, he dates her.  Everybody else is seeing her as a, as a big person.    It's really funny, there there's  some really funny parts in it.   But, I recommend watching this movie it's really good.	3.0
Alright, so   I'm here to talk about the movie Borat.   Now the movie Borat I just checked this movie out in theaters just a few days ago.   And this might be the best movie of 2006 no joke. Maybe even some may say the best movie of 2006 or not 2006, but you know, best movie ever.   And let me tell you why.   Alright so the movie starts off with   this guy's name is Borat and he lives in Kazakhstan and he's  a tv journalist in in   Kazakhstan   and they send him out to the United States to get,   to get  like, information and stuff to show to about how the how the  people in the US live and how they do their things so he can   teach it to the people in Kazakhstan.   Now from the movie he steps off in the airport in New York City it's, it  gets hilarious. I mean,   now this movie is not scripted, I mean they went around   and they just, they actually did it like he was an actual foreigner and they went around and got, got , they actually just went around and talked to people about this.   So you know this movie is great and I mean I laughed so many times in the movie I'm not gonna give away the ending or anything but that's pretty much what the movie's about and it just might be the best thing, might be the best movie ever honestly I mean it was a great movie I laughed so hard and you know if you know Borat from the Ali G show you know you'll be on the edge of your seat laughing throughout the  entire movie.   So make sure to get out there and check out Borat.	4.83
Okay this is Alex today.   I am reviewing star wars which is a documentary about graffiti in the nineteen-eighties.   It takes place in New York   and it is a two disk set.   One is the film and the other is the hall of fame which is just a sort of stuff about different graffiti artists. So   it's a pretty good set and stuff graffiti is pretty cool.  If you like hip hop or break dancing or graffiti you're pretty cool then you should get this.   So   it was directed by Tony Silver.   I don't know who that is but   maybe he's famous. Someone is watching this and like oh man Tony Silver, that's my idol. I never personally heard of him but    it's a 70 minute movie so it's not especially long but  it is pretty cool and lots of cool like  scenes and stuff so I really I don't know I really like this movie  kinda into graffiti and so    if you don't really know much about graffiti you should watch this because it gives you a pretty good background about how it started and stuff so   it's a pretty good DVD. It's not the best, there's other good ones but this one   this one is alright I don't know if I would buy it but if you get a chance to watch it, you should.	1.414
Hi, my name is Catherine and I want to talk to you about one of Walt Disney's newer movies  called   Lilo and Stitch.    This movie was surprisingly    very cute and very good.   The reason I say surprisingly is because I grew up with those classic Disney movies and I'm always afraid that the newer ones aren't going to be quite as good.    But this one has quickly earned it's way into my heart to become one of my favorites.   It's a original story.   It starts out with Stitch the alien who is    in big trouble because he's kind of    a brat around some of the other planets and his his  creator is in trouble for creating a new species.   Stitch escapes as he's being hauled away to prison and he makes his way to Earth and lands on the island of Hawaii where he gets put into the dog pound.   Lilo, who's the little girl living with her sister because their parents have died,   Lilo decides that she wants a dog and so her sister takes her to go to the dog pound and of course she picks out Stitch.   Stitch causes havoc   in both of their lives.   But at the end, it ends up being    that he becomes part of their family.   It's a very cute story. Features a lot of Elvis songs for those Elvis fans.   And there's a lot of memorable characters in it.   There's other human characters   and a couple of alien ones as well.   There's a couple of original songs also and there are some special features on this DVD, including some deleted scenes.   There's also a really cute short where Stitch is wreaking havoc in some of the other classic Disney movies.   So that's a little animated thing that was very funny to watch.   And there's also    a music video   and a game. So  I definitely recommend this for kids and I also recommend it for adults, even though you also may have grown up with those classic Disney movies and maybe a little wary about it.   This is definitely a good buy.	5.477
Hi, today I'm presenting the movie that is in theaters.    It's called Borat.    , I would give this movie a five out five and two thumbs up.    It is a hilarious movie.  I loved it, and I laughed my butt off while I watched it.   , It's mostly about this guy named Borat who is a Kazaky reporter in America,  and he's trying to learn about the culture and stuff here, and because he's so different   he ends up making a fool out of himself and it's hilarious. , It's kind of in a,  mock documentary kind of style reality show kind of style where they follow him around  with their cameras, and you see the wonderful interactions he has with Americans.    Of course it's all a big joke,   but, it's hilarious to see him.   And he goes to like different places, and , and , country rodeos in the south and things like that.    So, I definitely recommend you going and seeing Borat the movie.    It's hilarious, and you'll laugh your butt off.    I give it a five out of five.	5.477
Hey, guys, I'm here to talk about one of the greatest movies I've ever seen in my life.    you might think, Oh, what is it? Titanic? Pulp Fiction? No, Chasing Amy.   Written and directed by Kevin Smith, it's about two comic book artists. And one of them is in love with a girl, but he finds out she's a lesbian. And he tells her he loves her, and it evolves into this crazy, crazy loving relationship with a really surprising ending. It's like an ending I've never seen in my life.   Like all Kevin Smith movies, this one was very funny, had great dialog, and it also had some, you know, explicit stuff, but, you know, this is a great movie if you're an adult.   This movie has great illustrations. Jay and Silent Bob make cameos. The, the monologs are beautiful and very smart and they're very realistic. And the characters are not two-dimensional. They're all three-dimensional characters.    So after the main character, Holden, played by Ben Affleck, finds out that the girl he likes is lesbian,  he gets her to turn around, but he finds out a lot of things in her past that he didn't want to find out. It is very exciting. It's very funny.   It also stars Jason Lee and Kevin Smith as Silent Bob. This is probably one of Kevin Smith's best movies yet. So, you know, I highly recommend this movie. You know, it will probably be the best thing you ever seen. It's won a lot of awards. So, you know, I highly recommend it.  Once again, that's Chasing Amy, on DVD now. Pick it up.	6.351
Hi I will review for you the special collector's edition of Tae Guk Gi.   A Korean war film,    the title actually translates to The Brotherhood of War.    The movie itself is a lot like Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers.    It's a really stylized film, so you can really get   the grittiness of war that's going on all the   battles and stuff in this, in the movie.    It is about a   the story between of two brothers who are forced to join   a war going on in Korea,   between the north the north  and south.      As far as the actual disc,    DVD collection goes,    it comes in a two disc set,    the first disc is the widescreen version of the film and the second disc is   a bonus disc that comes with about three hours of footage of   behind the scenes, cast documentaries, and outtakes.    It is a really well made movie and a really well made  DVD collector's edition.    Altogether it totals about six hours of total footage, so it's a really well,   well made investment if you purchase this.	4.435
I'm reviewing The Devil's Advocate.     This movie stars Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino.     Rated yeah, rated R.    , There's nudity and language, all kinds of good stuff in this one.    , It's basically about Satan and his spawn.    Al Pacino who is AKA Satan,  goes after his son who is Keanu Reeves.     He ends up impregnating a human,    and the result is Keanu Reeves.    So he's trying to get Keanu Reeves, and he's also, Satan's also got a daughter,   and  he's trying to get them to kind of , get together   and have  a child.  , So he's,  doesn't let, Keanu doesn't know that he's   Satan or anything.    But , he's. Keanu is a lawyer and he goes   and works for his   father who is Satan.  And , so it's just a story about that,   , good and evil basically.    But this is a good movie, you should see it.	3.559
I'm reviewing Schindler's List. This is a really good movie. It is rated R.   It's not really appropriate for children.   I guess you just kinda have to use your own judgement. This is based on a true story.   It's kind of a historical film.   It's  won    seven Academy Awards.   The movie is  basically about   a guy that helps    the Jews in the holocaust   by making a list and hiring them on to work with him.   It kind of just goes along and and shows you what happened during that time   and some of the people that did try to help   and the guy Schindle is one of em.   It is a tear jerker movie, you will cry.   But I definitely recommend this movie.   And as I said, whether it's appropriate for kids, I think you should probably watch it and judge yourself.   And that's Schindler's List.	3.559
Hi, I'm here to talk to you about A Charlie Brown Christmas.  This is a really cute, well it's not really a movie. It's more like two episodes making an hour long movie. But this is a really cute deal here.  Especially around the holidays and  when families are getting together.  This was about fifteen dollars at Wal Mart but you can get it anywhere, especially around Christmas time.  It's very cute. Charlie Brown's trying to find the meaning of Christmas and  you know Snoopy is prancing around teasing him and   you know, all the characters are in this. All the original characters.  This is just really adorable. Each episode being about twenty minutes long, making this about an hour long DVD.   It's just really cute. It has lots of bonus features and I highly recommend this.	2.517
The Chronicles of Riddick is a futuristic movie.   This is actually  the second one in the series.   It's, the the  first one also starred Vin Diesel. Basically Vin Diesel is kind of this  renegade outlaw sort of guy who decides to band together with these other renegade outlaw guys and save the future of the human race.   Some real defining features about  The Chronicles of Riddick are the stunning visual effects. I mean the whole thing takes place in the future. So you have this kind of feel of   the human race failing and  kind of the line between good and evil is is kind of separated because we don't know if the authority is evil or if these people uprising against the authority are the evil ones, it's hard to tell. But basically, the people that we're rooting for are Vin Diesel and his crew because he's going to  try and save the human race.   So, if you're looking for a nice action movie, check out The Chronicles of Riddick.	4.123
Right here with me today I have Seabiscuit.    It's actually the horse movie also after the book.      It's a very famous book it's about a horse and    an owner and everything.    I definitely would recommend this book if if  you are interested in horses.    And it's set  in the past, it's  very interesting.    It's got a lot of  nice horses for everybody who loves horses or horse enthusiasts are interested in    horse racing. It's    it's actually a sad story, actually  get,   you actually feel for the horse and    it's it's  a really a good story.    Not not  for those people who enjoy say, more of the violence, more of the  guns blazing.   But  this is more of a real life kind of    something that could happen story where    it's a story of a boy who     gets a horse who    is  not not  all highly thought of but    in the end works his way all the way up so I would definitely  recommend this   for horse lovers.    For anybody who likes this sort of movie but  not for   more of the action packed or horror type or movie people.    This is a different movie.    From usual. So   if you wanna change from the usual, definitely  I would suggest getting this movie.	4.359
Okay here I have the DVD version of Singing in, or Singin In The Rain.    This stars a Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds.   This is a classic movie that  when it was put on DVD it was very nice because it has lots of special features. This is a two disc DVD which features the movie and then also   kind of a couple featurettes of making the movie and also some biographies of Gene Kelly who was  the director and choreographer of the movie, or he was at least choreographer of the movie   which is pretty impressive because the dancing in this movie is really nice.   Singin In The Rain is a movie musical and    it's a very interesting one. It Stars   Debbie Reynolds who  basically is this young performer who meets up with Gene Kelly who is this hot shot    movie maker and   it's just a great movie musical. So    if you're looking for a good old fun movie, I recommend Singin In the Rain.	4.359
Hi here with me today I have the DVD called The Ghost and the Darkness.   It has Michael Douglas and Val Kilmer in it.    I don't think is one of the best movies  ever it's about    is about  two guys who   go to Africa because they've been called upon because  a village over there in East Africa,   this is set in 1996, has a   problem because there's two man-eating lion, lions  who are  killing a lot of the people there.   So these people are commissioned to hunt the animals. So they have a lot of problems  during that time and they set up traps which   the lions  actually  outsmart them with, so it's actually kind of interesting.   But it's a very drawn out long movie,    not really interesting the ending's   pretty lame and kind of flops in the end.    Which is why I guess this movie this movie  didn't really  hit big or anything.   But   this is  I wouldn't, it's not really a action movie I'd classify more as like a, it's like a story.    And then you don't feel sympathetic for anybody in this movie.    Not the lions, not the people, not the hunters or the    village people so   there's nobody really to side with in here.      It's, it , I wouldn't suggest this, it's    not a, not a very great movie, not all very well put together.    In the end   you'll, you'll  get a taste of boredom in your mouth.	4.082
This is my DVD review on The Buddy Holly Story. It was filmed and released in nineteen-seventy-eight, it's about two hours long. It is PG,   I would even say any kind of kid could catch it. It obviously   goes through the story of Buddy Holly, the singer in the fifties. It is timeless just because his music we still hear it on the radio,   Peggy Sue, It's So Easy, you know, That'll Be the Day. I,  it's funny  Gary Busey he is such a good actor in this and kind of like Ring of Fire with the Johnny Cash story it is actually Gary Busey singing. They were going to dub it with Buddy Holly's original voice but   this is his breakout role, Gary Busey, and he is a singer turned actor and it is a wonderful movie. It goes through just  Buddy Holly's life. If you like the movies Ray, Ring of Fire, those type of , you know, Patsy Kline films and stuff you'll really like this.  The Buddy Holly Story. And  it's timeless, you don't have to have been born in the fifties or even,  you know, have  known anybody in the fifties. This is  a good movie, it's a good story, it's very heartwarming. And of course everybody knows the tragic ending of Buddy Holly. But I would recommend this if you haven't seen it, and this The Buddy Holly Story.	5.686
Hi, this is Jack and I'm reviewing the new movie out   The Good Shepherd,   starring Matt Damon, Angelina Jolie, William Hurt, Alec Baldwin, Robert De Niro, so I mean, obviously you can tell it's got an all-star cast. But unfortunately, I don't think  an all-star cast really makes up or really makes the film.    This is for, this is  Robert De Niro's return to directing for since the last thirteen years. I really really wish he could have done a better job.   I mean the story involved with the CIA part of it, with Matt Damon you know in the CIA, it's it's  interesting, but sometimes it seems kind of stretched out. And there are parts of it that are boring, but the really bad part about the movie  is all these things all these parts having to do with his family. I mean  I understand that's kind of an important part of a movie but it made up about a third of the movie and I really wanted to sleep through all of it.  The movie is almost three hours long. So I mean it's a really really long movie. I was bored through most of it.   I mean I was really really disappointed. With an all-star cast like this, apparently good director, you know and excellent story, you'd think they'd be able to do it but I don't think it was worth it. So I do not recommend The Good Shepherd.	3.742
Here I have the DVD of Charlie's Angels which is a remake of the seventies TV show.   It stars Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu and   they're butt kicking chicks fighting bad guys and how it works is they're our angels and Charlie is like their boss and he helps to bring down crime, but you never actually see him. He speaks through  a speaker phone to talk to them.  But there's also another guy who is  like the Angel's Angel's  boss but Charlie's his boss. He's like the middle man, his name's Bosley, and in this movie he's played by Bill Murray, who is very very funny.   Pretty much they are just trying to get a bad guy. It's been a while since I've seen it  but it has something to do with protecting peoples identities.  Anyways,   so it's really cute cause the girls will go through different personas undercover, like masseuses and it's pretty much the directors wanting to show off pretty girls in pretty costumes.   But    I think it's really entertaining and it kicks some serious butt.   Charlie's Angels.	4.83
Here I have the movie Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark.   I love Indiana Jones.   He is played by   Harrison Ford.   Who I think is a pretty good looking man.    He's an archaeologist   and this is actually the first movie out of the trilogy.    And he just is going on adventures to discover artifacts   and to   pick them up before the Nazis do.   He's pretty much fighting the Nazis in all three of the movies.    This one starts off with that whole   rolling giant ball   and    you've seen that   places a million times,   so. This is where it's from. It's really cool thing that I like about Indiana Jones is that they always start off the movies   with him recovering something   that has nothing to do with the rest of the movie it's just starting it off with   action. And so that's pretty much what that whole rolling ball thing is about.    He meets a girl he used to date   and she helps him look for   the lost ark of the covenant    and they're just trying to find it before the Nazis do,   cuz they don't want the Nazis to gain power and blah blah blah.   And I don't know either   but this was  set in like during World War Two,   so it's a, it's a  really cute movie. Like it's really funny and that's just great adventure in it, George Lucas is an amazing filmmaker   and I recommend the Indiana Jones trilogy and this one is the best out of the three.	3.786
Here I have the DVD to the  musical Jesus Christ Superstar. Now  this was a musical before it was made into a movie and it was really really popular when it was made into a movie. My mom really isn't into the new whole music scene but she does  remember in the seventies going to see this in the theaters.  It stars Ted Neely as  the role of Jesus Christ and at first I was sort of scared that they might be making fun of the bible or poking fun at it but it's really not. It's just telling the story and singing and dancing in it.  It is a little funny watching it now because it was made in the seventies and there are bell-bottoms and just really funny seventies stuff.   It is shot in the desert and  the girl who plays Mary Magdeline in this movie is, she's a Native American woman and she was nominated for   an Academy Award and she was like the first in Native American woman to be nominated so that's pretty cool. It's a really good movie. They came out with a new one a couple years ago that is absolutely terrible. So if you like Jesus Christ Superstar I recommend this.  I used to watch it at my church so if  you're a pastor or anything I recommend it.	5.745
This is the widescreen special edition version of Underworld: Evolution.   Starring Kate Beckinsale, it's the sequel to the   hit movie Underworld.   In which she plays a vampire.    And in this  movie she has to   fight a new group of    vampire werewolf hybrids which are trying to take over the world.    Movie wasn't that great.    on the DVD the best  comment they can get is explosive entertainment from someone at FoxTV so they know,    wasn't that well received.   But Kate Beckinsale looks fantastic in this movie.   She's super hot and you'll enjoy the movie for that aspect.    In terms of the DVD features it does have  a few special features  directors and filmmakers commentary.   A few documentaries about  how the visual effects were made, how the stunts were made.    How the creatures were thought up.    So   if you're a fan of the first movie I would suggest getting this    because it will complete your Underworld collection but if you're, if you really didn't like this movie I wouldn't you know, tell you to go out and buy it right away.	4.69
This is the DVD Ocean's Eleven, directed by Steven Soderbergh.    This is I'm pretty sure a remake but    It's kind of revamped and everything and it's, I've never seen the first one but I'm completely satisfied with this one. It stars George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Julia Roberts. It's really like an all star cast.  It's about Danny Ocean, who is George Clooney and so he's got like this band of thieves and it's eleven of them. And so they're trying to rob a casino and this casino is owned by Andy Garcia.   And Andy Garcia is actually dating Julia Roberts who is George Clooney's, I think, ex wife. And so,  it's kind of a cool story cause you want the bad guys to win cause Andy Garcia's sort of a jerk and you know it's really really  great thought out movie and it's really entertaining and it's got a lot of twists in it. So I completely recommend Ocean's Eleven if you haven't seen it.	5.972
Okay, I have a very, very special movie in my hand. This is Wet Hot American Summer on DVD. This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen in my entire life. It's got   everyone in it. It's got Michael Ian Black, it's got Michael Showalter, a lot of just really, really funny people, the people who were  responsible for Stella  on Comedy Central and they've done lots of other things. They've been involved in pretty much just about anything that you can think of.  Some other people in it: Molly Shannon from Saturday Night Live is in it, Janeane Garofalo, David Hyde Pierce he's on  Frasier. He's also in this movie and  it's really, really hilarious. It's actually it says right here at the bottom, hilarious.  And  let's see, what can I say about it? The story revolves around  the summer at a camp and I've been to a summer camp before so I can relate to it but even if you haven't it's got lots of really funny things. It all takes place over the span of one day and    it takes place in the eighties and just hilarity ensues. It's really  it can't be described in words, it has to be seen, and if you haven't seen this movie it is one of the best  recent comedies that I've seen.    What else can I say? It's ninety-seven minutes so it's not too long, it's about an hour and a half. And it's got  an amazing cast, it's got some really funny  like  some {sigh} funny, like off-color kind of humor if that's what you like, it's the kind of humor I like to listen to and this is  a movie I like to see and if you're like me you will like it too, so check it out.	4.243
Hello,   I'm doing a movie review   of the movie Eragon.   It is in theaters almost everywhere.   Now I'm a fan of Harry Potter, I've seen all the Harry Potter movies.   I also have seen all of the Lord of the Rings movies.   Now the Lord of the Rings movies got a little long for me.   Though they were still good.   I found Eragon's plot   to be a little thin.   And actually,   while I was at Eragon I wanted to be   Eragone out of the theater and away from that movie. Because I found it boring. It wanted me to go to,   go to  sleep to be honest.   {noise} So I    tried to struggle through it.   I went to get some popcorn.   Ate it, wondered if I'd like the movie if I were eating and not paying   full attention to it but I didn't really like it any more.   It's probably a movie for younger boys.   Younger boys who can't quite grasp a full plot.   It's for younger boys who maybe have read the book too because then they'll like seeing everything they read in the book come to life.   One thing I found cheesy and awkward about the movie   was how the dragon and the main boy   Eragon   talked with their minds.   Let me do an impression of them.   That is what they looked like when they talked and it was awful.   Hard to watch. But maybe the younger kids would like it.   So if you're a younger kid then maybe watch it. But if you're older you might be bored.	4.796
Hi,   I'm reviewing the movie Rocky Balboa, which is currently in theaters.  It is the sixth edition in the Rocky series.   It's it's  gotten great reviews around but, to tell you the truth,  I thought they should have stopped at Rocky one.   I just thought this was too much. Sylvester Stallone was a great actor but  he's now pushing sixty and having him in this role,   you know,  same old thing, you know.  He goes out,   we all know he's gonna fight, he's gonna win.   So,  it was a, it's a typical Rocky movie but  I see where it got some good reviews but I'm pretty much a little tired of the whole Rocky scene. So  if you weren't liking Rockys three, four, five, then trust me, you do not want to see this movie. Don't waste your money.   I don't know how some people  loved it.   You know the acting was okay. You all know it's the same thing over and over that happens with Rocky movies.  If they would have stopped   Rocky one, I think it would have been great but,   you know.      You know, scene wise, there are a couple of good scenes in it.   So if you're a Rocky, I guess if you're a die hard Rocky fan, this is a great movie.   But as I said before, if you if you  haven't been feeling the other Rocky movies as of late, I wouldn't waste my time seeing this.  I saw it because it was a friend of mine recommended it.  But  it was a waste of time so keep that in mind  before you go and waste ten dollars on this  overrated and highly dragged out movie. I think that's how I'd put it.	4.655
Hi, I am reviewing the movie Eragon, which is currently in theaters. Now I was a, I'm a fan  of fantasy movies so when I saw some of the commercials for this I thought alright, I'm gonna go check this movie out.  If you you're  a fan of fantasy movies, or any type of movie for that matter  do not see this movie.   It was a horrible ripoff of The Lord of The Rings.   It was just a mess. The dialogues were horrible,   performances were  awful if you ask me.   I thought, I don't understand how some people could approve this movie and put it out for production, it was just awful.   I'd say about halfway through the movie, I had enough, I had to walk out. People before me were walking out of this movie. So you know, even little kids with parents were leaving this movie. That's how bad I thought it was and    apparently other people thought it was too.  So you know, if you're looking for a movie to see, then do not see this one, because it will disappoint and you will lose your money.   So if you you  bought this, if you go and see this movie and you don't listen to me, you will be sorry.	5.745
What I have up for review here is the New Line platinum series widescreen edition of The Wedding Crashers, starring Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson and Christopher Walken.   And this one is actually the uncorked edition. Longer, wilder and funnier.   The movie takes place  during a wedding party  initially.    The two characters actually play wedding crasher where they try to charm their way into the hearts of bridesmaids and hope to go home with them later that evening.   But during this one party of the US  Secretary of Treasury, played by Christopher Walken   the guys, Owen Wilson's character actually finds himself falling for    the Secretary's daughter, and they invite them to go home with them to their estate over the weekend   and he actually   pleads Vince Vaughns character to come with him and join him  over the weekend at this big estate.  And most of the movie takes place at this estate. It's hilarious.   I was laughing   right through the movie. I can't even stop laughing.   And there's some special features which give about eight and a half more minutes to the movie. I suggest going to pick this up tonight if you were looking for a hilarious comedy. Go out and rent it, it's great. The Wedding Crashers.	5.066
Hi, I'm going to review for you today the DVD of Lara Croft: Tomb Raider.   This is not a very good movie at all, but if you like the video game Tomb Raider it's based on that and  that was one of my very favorite favorite video games ever, and so of course I had to get the movie.   The plot in it's really bad.   The acting's not that great. It's fun to watch     Angeline Jolie be Tomb Raider, but I mean  it's not really not that interesting. There's a lot of action and fighting and shooting, but  the bad guy's not even that  bad, I think. He's just does a typical  overacting sort of job.  If you can find it for cheap and you like Tomb Raider  that would be a good thing to get it, but don't pay over five dollars for this. It's not really worth it.   If you can see it on TV for free that's good too. But the DVD has special edition stuff so if you wanna see  behind the scenes and things like that. So  if you can find it for cheap, buy it. If not, don't bother.	3.697
Hi, I'm gonna review for you today the DVD Love Potion Number Nine.  This is a movie with Tate Donovan  and Sandra Bullock and basically it's based on   the song Love Potion Number Nine  but it has a lot more {cough} has a lot more  plot than just the simple song.    But  basically they find this potion from the gypsy that allows you when you speak to someone they fall in love with you  and so both, these are both chemists  and they test out the stuff and she becomes  his prince.    Becomes in love with her, and then her ex-boyfriend gets it and it's very complicated and it's basically a love comedy  and it's from the eight,  actually it's from nineteen ninety two.  It's both early in , both of their careers.   {cough}  It's really funny and it's a great movie where you get to see people  play comedy and I recommend it to you.	3.317
Hello, I'm Matthew, and I'm here to tell you about this DVD once again  and it stars Bill Murray and it's called Scrooged.  Many of you people have probably already heard about this movie. It's a   classic remake done in the eighties about   a movie and the book, A Christmas Carol and  this is the widescreen edition. If you like Bill Murray like I do, you'll really like this movie. Also if you like Christmas movies, this one is pretty good. It has a lot of the same story line as   A Christmas Carol, but in a lot more comedy way.   This DVD costs fourteen dollars,   and the gist of the story is, in case you don't know, is that he is very hateful about Christmas and he gets visited by three ghosts.  The ghost of Christmas Past, Present and Future, and he finds the meaning of life.  If you like Bill Murray, I would highly recommend this movie.	4.082
Hello, I am Matthew and I'm here to tell you about this   DVD  Underworld, the two disc unrated extended  version and  if you haven't gotten this DVD previously  I would say go with this DVD. It has twenty-three minutes of bonus material   of cut out footage versus the other DVD release of this movie  and it also includes a documentary of making of the movie and a forty-eight page booklet about   the production of the movie.   I found this movie, in general, very satisfying. It's the story line is between vampires and werewolves battling and it's got a very Gothic feel. It's not cheesy like other vampire movies. But it's   got a very nice feel to it, and like I said, if you  haven't gotten this movie already, I would recommend this version.  But if you have gotten it, I really wouldn't recommend the upgrade. Saying it's only twenty-three minutes of bonus material.  This movie,  costs   nineteen dollars at Wal Mart, and if you haven't seen it, I would highly recommend it.	5.477
Hi I'm Jesse and  today I'm going to talk to you for just a brief moment about Stanley Kubrick's two thousand one A space Odyssey. And I took the word brief very poignantly because this movie is anything but. It's  about, yeah it says here, four thousand minutes long which it translates to over forty hours somehow and .   Sure it's a classic and there's a lot of symbolism that you see all over in in  our culture,  especially The Simpson's. But   And and  of course that whole I'm afraid I can't do that Dave is from this. And so, you kind of have to see this at some point on your life just so you know what it's about. But  if you're looking to have like a nice relaxing time or if you really enjoy science fiction,    spend your money elsewhere. This movie is immensely boring. There's one part where they  go to Mars or something and they show the entire trip to Mars like unabridged. It's it's  like four days where they're just in stasis and the camera moves around occasionally. It's like a surveillance camera on a spaceship. It's  incredibly boring. But there's  I guess there's some neat ideas or something cause I  {laugh}  I couldn't, I was asleep for most of it but people just, that's what I'm reading on the internet. Anyway  I really  not a good movie  classic but no.	2.517
Right now I'm going to be reviewing  The Descent.  The  movie came out last summer and I watched it recently and I feel that it was   kind of a lackluster effort by the    people who made this movie.  Basically it's  about a group of women who annually go on an adventure. This year they decide to   go exploring some    underground caves and    they get lost due to a cave in   and proceed to be attacked by some weird kind of   creatures.  The movie is really fast paced, kind of lacks a plot.  There's a little twist at the end, which I didn't really care for  and had a little trouble understanding  and seemed a little disjointed there at the very end.   I give it a two out of five.	5.0
Hello, Will here   and today I'll be reviewing   Charlie's Angels.  This is not the full throttle version, this is the first one.   And   it's pretty good.   I wouldn't go out and say, you know, go out of your way and buy it,   but  if you like  Drew Barrymore and Carmen Diaz's acting,   and Lucy Liu,   go out and buy it. Otherwise it's not really worth the price.      It was okay.   It didn't really    reflect the series   as well as everyone thought it should have, if you're a fan of the  Charlie's Angels TV series. I mean,  the the  people elements are there, it's just   not really the same,   so    I don't know,   with special features and all I would say you know,   don't go out and get it.  If you're going go out and get   you know, you get this one and full throttle which is the second Charlie's Angels    together  for cheap, go ahead but   don't bother.   All right.	3.367
Hello, and today I'm going to review the movie Borat, currently in theaters.  I'm sure most of you have already heard about this movie and perhaps seen the previews for it. And  the previews,   and oftentimes for movies the previews show the most important parts and the most interesting parts of the movie and then the rest of the movie's pretty boring, but in this one they don't  do the movie justice.    The movie is first of all it's hilarious, there's many many great scenes.  The actor in it is Sacha Baron Cohen and he does other popular  shows such as Ali G,   which  mostly plays in the UK.   And  this movie does have a lot of crude humor so it is definitely not for  children, and maybe not even teenagers without parental supervision. There is  nudity of sorts, and definitely obscene language and obscene scenes,   but overall it's a hilarious movie with a lot of funny parts. The only real problem I see with it is that  perhaps it goes a little too far when it makes fun of people, and makes fun of cultures.    I think it goes a little too far in some of those aspects and  might not  have good humor but sometimes too offensive. Like I said, overall it's a great movie, it's hilarious, I enjoyed it a lot. I highly recommend anyone who's seen Sacha Baron Cohen's previous work and I also recommend it for people who haven't seen it because, like I said, it's it's  a great movie.  Just don't bring your children to it because, like I said, there are some obscene parts.   Once again it's called  Borat and  the name's actually pretty long but   the main important part of it is Borat.	4.082
Hi. Today I will be reviewing this Primus Live two-thousand-four DVD.  I went to a show in Berkeley on this tour so I thought I'd check out the DVD. It's actually from a set in Chicago and basically the premise behind this tour was that they did,   they had no opening band, their first set they just played  songs off of all their albums except for Frizzle Fry, which their second set they played the entire CD. And this is just a good account of what it was like.    It's an indoor theater and the crowd has a lot of energy.  The camera camera  works really well and the sound's really good on this DVD.  If you're into Primus you'll definitely want to check this out. If you're not sure what their tour's like you'll also want to check this out.    The run time on it is about two and a half hours so you get a lot for your money cause you can get this for about ten dollars, if not less. And   so you can pick this up probably at Tower Records or at Borders if you're looking for it. And, yeah, check it out. Thank you.	4.435
This is a movie called Summer Magic and it stars Hayley Mills and Burl Ives   and of course Burl Ives is dead now but  it's really kind of a musical and   Hayley Mills is from a well to do Boston family and they lose their money   and  I think it's the mother and Hayley Mills and you know, a couple of siblings  and they end up moving to this town in Maine which Burl Ives is the post master there and he  kind of rents Hayley Mills    this house based on a letter that Hayley Mills writes to him  and   the house is actually owned by another guy but the   Burl Ives kinda manages the house.  So he rents it to them, course they can't pay any money, they can't pay any rent for it  and so it's a good story. Eventually the    owner of the house comes to town to check on the property and finds out that Hayley Mills and their family is living there with   you know not paying any rent. So that becomes interested  interesting. It's a funny story, it's a nice family movie. It's an older movie, but I would definitely recommend seeing it and you can get this at amazon dot com for under twelve dollars.	5.066
Hi. This is a movie called Memoirs of a Geisha and this is a really good movie. It's one  it  it had six Academy Award nominations   and    this is the story that takes place just before World War Two and goes through World War Two in Japan. And, you know, when I first heard the title of it I didn't think it would be a very good movie, but it turned out to be a really good movie.   In fact I saw it twice on the big screen which I rarely see movies twice,   even on the  big screen or DVD I just don't like to watch movies again, but this one I did.  The story's good, it's kind of a Cinderella story  and  the  Cinderella story about a girl who grows up in   , you know, kind of a bad part of town  in this town of Japan after being sold. Her parents have to sell her  they don't have to, they sold her and her sister, you know, I guess for medical,  to pay the medical bills of the mother who was dying, sick so it's kind of a family separation and then she goes into the bad part of town and  tells about her life. And this is a really good movie, I  it's got a good story line to it and most of all it's got really good photography. The photography in this thing is exceptional, which is one of the reasons I went back to see it. So I would rate this five out of five, no hesitation. You can get this movie on  at Amazon dot com for, you know, under fifteen dollars.	5.745
Hi, my name is Logan and this piece of dog crap is   The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.   This  stars Sean Connery. It's just so stupid.  It's set in like the eighteen hundreds and it's like fantasy and   you know, the  first of all the main star, or the main guy in , there's like all these like Captain Nemo's in it and then other people, other famousishy people from around that time were in it. I have never heard of Alan Quartermain. I don't know what they were thinking when they decided that Sean Connery should star as Alan Quartermain. It doesn't make any sense but   I don't know. It it's   pretty dumb. There's like a vampire in it, an invisible guy, Captain Nemo, a guy that can't die cause he's like he starts out as a good guy and then he goes to a bad guy. It's really just a dull story line. It was an excuse to get Sean Connery into a James Bondish role without being James Bond cause they didn't want to pay for that and he  shoots people and he acts like oh I'm Sean Connery {mumble} you gotta shoot people, this is how you do it. I can't do a very  good Sean Connery voice but  this was really lame movie. I mean, come on Sean, can't do you do better than that?  It's just {sigh}.   It's like he was really hurting for money so he picked the first script that came along. It's just a horrible, stupid movie. It doesn't make a lot of sense. The action sequences are sometimes way too long and sometimes they're too short and it just, it jumps around, it's like oh he's going to his, you know, his  his castle of fortressness, we have to go get him. So they go up into the mountains or something after the bad guy. It's like how do they know he was there? Why did he go there? That's like the first place you would think he would go, why would you I don't know. It was a really dull story line, it doesn't make a lot of sense.   Don't get this movie.  It's from the director of Blade, that should have told me   in the first place cause Blade sucked, this sucks. Don't rent it, don't buy it, don't waste your time. You could spend two hours doing something better with your life than watching this piece of junk.	6.055
Hey shoppers, my name is Chip, and this is The Bourne Supremacy.  This is the sequel to The Bourne Identity starring  Matt Damon.  The story about an agent who , in this particular episode,    he knows who he is,  he's met a girl in the last one and they have  started a new life  across the ocean in another country, a little island.  And in this episode  people have tracked him down and  they are pretty sure that he knows details of the secret involvement with  Russian oil contracts and a lot of money and  espionage and they figure if they can take him out then their secret will be safe and    all will be well. And it is   when they go after him    pretty much    it breaks loose and he goes after them and  tries to settle the score.   It probably leaves it open for a  Bourne three. I hope it does because    both of these films have been  extraordinary to watch and to follow and  Matt Damon    makes a great character  with this.    It's The Bourne Supremacy, with Matt Damon.	4.83
HI, this is the DVD Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii and I picked this up for about, I think eight or nine dollars over at Best Buy and  I didn't really know exactly what was going on with this DVD but I checked it out and I was pleasantly surprised that it was actually really interesting. It has mostly, they play at Pompeii in the old coliseum   but no one's there. It's just kind of them. And then you also see kind of behind the scenes. You can see them working on Dark Side of the Moon album, which was really cool.    Inside it just comes with this one little booklet. It just kind of has some pictures and stuff.    But the DVD itself, it's not that long, but it's definitely interesting if you like Pink Floyd. It's not    really a concert video. But  it has enough tracks on it, that if you're looking for live performances, it definitely has that. Most of the songs on it are from before the Dark Side of the Moon. But there are a couple such as "Us and Them" and    "Brain Damage" on there that are from that album.   So, if you like Pink Floyd, this is a really cool DVD. Thank you.	3.916
Hello and welcome to my review of   Pinata, Survival Island.   This is a story of   a bunch of college students who go to an island for    a treasure hunt.   And they end up breaking this ancient pinata which releases some demon   and then   of course, chaos ensues.   This movie is pretty bad.   It is    {laugh} it's less than a B movie.   The only reason to see this is  if you are a fan of Jaime Pressly or Nicholas Brandon,    those are the two stars.    Jaime Pressly of course from My Name Is Earl fame and Nicholas Brendon from Buffy the Vampire Slayer.   Only reason why the, to really to see this movie. The special features   there aren't very many, there's a feature commentary and some other   junk but who who  really cares because this movie is pretty bad.    I I  have to mention that on the back of the dvd it actually says evil has gone wack.   So if that gives you any indication of where this movie is going,    if that doesn't I don't know what will.   So this is Pinata, Survival Island.   Unless you're really, really bored, I'd stay away.	6.403
Hello and welcome to my review of Dig.   A film by Ondi   Timoner, I don't know if I said that right. But    Ondi Timoner.    This is    a documentary about two bands,   the Dandy Warhols and the Brian Jonestown Massacre.   Two     well they're, they're well known and in, in  some circles not so well known in others,    bands.  This, it chronicles seven years of both band's lives. It, it  takes you    it shows the rise of the Dandy Warhols and   the  critical  the commercial success that they  attained. And the   critical success and    commercial fall of   the  Brian Jonestown Massacre.    This is,   this is an incredible film.    It won the  Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance film festival.    It  it just, it really gets in depth with the bands.    How they were once great friends and   because of   their successes and    failures they drew apart   and nothing was really ever the same for them.  Because of  the music industry and their,   just the personalities basically.    This is definitely worth checking out, it's packed with special, special  features it's a two disc    there's two discs,  there's videos,    commentaries,    behind the scenes footage, all, all  kinds of stuff.    This is definitely   a documentary to check out especially if you're a music fan whether you've heard of these bands or not. You should definitely see this movie,   this is Dig.   I highly recommend it.	5.26
Hi my name is Roy Daley and this is the Groundhog Day special edition DVD    with Bill Murray. It's the movie where he keeps reliving the same day over and over.    this is probably one of my favorite, if not my favorite movie.    It is  a great movie and this DVD is    it's a great DVD. It's widescreen, the movie looks great,  there    just like in the theaters and everything.    has all the the the  digitally remastered and the dolby audio and everything. Special features are    are good.   I enjoyed them, there's audio commentary from the director. There's a  feature about the weight of time and how    the whole thing works, and how, you know how they got the concept of doing a movie like this and which is actually pretty interesting.    some trailers and  some stuff like that.    but mostly just the commentary and the documentary, that the feature about time and what not. So   it's a great  DVD for a great movie. I love it and     it's a solid DVD. Again that's the special edition Groundhog Day DVD.	2.708
Hi. My Roger and I want to tell you about a movie called Body Double.   Now this is a Brian De Palma movie that came out back in nineteen eighty four   and I will tell you back in the eighties when I first saw this movie, I thought it was a pretty good movie.    It had it as a mystery, intrigue,   you know, very, very, kind of   drama type  you know  investigative type movie   and  you know and back then I really enjoyed it. I thought it was a good movie about a guy who was house sitting and actually seeing somebody get murdered and all of the sudden she's there.   So they try to figure out how this happened.   But you know,   getting this movie a couple years ago because I saw it on the shelf and looked at it and I said, you know, it's kind of, it's it's  just not up to par with today's type of movies.    There's a little bit hocky  looking at it now the special effects were were  terrible, I mean they weren't that good at all   and the story wasn't as deep as I thought it originally was. So, you know, I'll take it, if you, if you  want to go back down through memory lane to see movies that were done back in the eighties,   this is obviously an eighties type movie.    It's not up to par with anything on today's standards and I'll tell you, I saw it again and I just I just  didn't enjoy it like I would of some of movies that, you know, that some of the other older movies so, but anyways it's called Body Double, it's rated R because its got some sexual   scenes in it and some cussing in it things like this language  and and  some nudity, you know and, and back in the eighties, I guess, you know when you look at the, the   {laughter}  the selection you had, this was a pretty good movie but in today's today's  standards, today's world, it really was a kinda a hocky eighties movie so I don't really recommend you go and get it or go and watch it again, there's probably some other movies that you probably rather watch instead of that.  But anyways, it's called Body Double and  it's got it's a Brian De Palma movie. Ok. Thanks.	5.196
Hi. How you doing? Let me tell you a little bit about this movie called Beauty and the Beast. Now, this is a special edition, which means it has another complete another DVD with a lot of special  effects on it. But this is Disney's Beauty and the Beast. And  we originally had this as a VHS,  but they did come back in and digitally remaster it, turn it, put it into a DVD format. And, you know, it's just a timeless story.  It's a good family movie.  Younger kids will just enjoy it, because you've got the princess, you've got the, the the  kind of the monster, which sometimes can be a little bit scary to real younger kids, but, you know, it's just them coming together. It's a nice heartwarming. It's a love story. It's enjoyable.   Anyway, it has, it's a musical, obviously. It's got quite a few songs in it, some songs that you've heard before.  But a lot of songs in it that they're just fun songs.  It is just typical Disney style , with a lot of  a little bit of goofiness, at lot of tongue in cheek, not a lot, just a little bit of tongue-in-cheek humor in it. So, as an adult, you kind of enjoy that a little bit too.  But  it is a it's  fun movie. It's a good movie to put, add to your collection. It is a Disney classic.  I know they only have these out, they only come out from time to time. So when it does become available again, I would go ahead and purchase one  because whether it's for your kids or your grandkids or whoever,  it's just a great movie to watch with them.   So take a look at the Beauty Walt Disney's Beauty and the Beast. And, like I said, this is a special edition, which it has  an extra DVD, which allows you to put something do something  in the computer with it and things like that. We don't really access that as much, but we do like to watch the special effect, because many times, it  the special  they tell you how they made the movie or they  give a little documentary on  you know, where the idea or how, how  certain characters were made. And this, they do a very good job explaining that. And it just kind of adds a little bit more to the value of the movie.   So take a good look at it.  Like I said, it's Beauty and the Beast by Walt Disney.	5.745
Hi, my name's Jennifer and I'm here to talk about the movie   Meet the Parents.   Now Meet the Parents stars Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro.   It's all about how Ben Stiller wants his girlfriend Pam's parents, who's Robert De Niro,   so that he can ask his girlfriend her hand in marriage but he's gonna get permission from her family first.   And this is just an incredibly funny movie where everything goes wrong.   So if you've ever had a boyfriend or a girlfriend and you've tried to meet their family   and just, the worst thing that could possibly happen has happened over and over again, that's what this movie's about.   First he loses his luggage, his suitcase    he's not in tune with the family secret so he ends up   just doing some very dumb stuff that he ends up getting caught for later.   You'll find out what it is,   that the ex-boyfriend he meets he doesn't make a very good impression, he doesn't make a good impression the rest of the family and just very funny.    How he comes out of it.   And how they come out of it together.   And you'll have to watch it to see if Ben Stiller ever does get to ask his girlfriend Pam to marry him, and if he ever gets his, her,    father's approval.   It's just a very good movie if you've liked movies like Dodgeball, or nearly the new Night In the Museum, you will xxx Meet the Parents.   And afterwards you'll have to see Meet the Fockers which is the sequel, which is just as good as the first one.   And this is from Dreamworks Pictures Universal Studios,   Meet the Parents starring Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro.	6.683
I'm going to be reviewing the movie Hamburger Hill.  This movie's about a    unit of American soldiers during the Vietnam war who have to defend   this   actually, no they have to attack this hill and    try to   remove the    North Vietnamese from there.   It's    it's a pretty sad movie, since    some   people who you weren't expecting to die do in fact die.   The    only thing about this movie is there's    some better   Vietnam movies out there and   with better casts.   This   cast is    the most notable person on here is probably   Don Cheadle or that guy from practice, I don't remember his name.   So   I give this movie    two out of five.	2.708
Doing a review on the movie Blade   the movie is rated R.    It stars Wesley Snipes and Steven Dorff.      Blade is   about   vampires.    Blade is the, a vampire, he is a mixed breed he does have the      ability to be a daywalker, he is immortal as well as half man.    And the   first movie    Blade, he    is sharpened his skills as far as being    a hunter.    But he's also trying to    go up against Deacon Frost which is    like the lord of the mortals.   Now  they are trying to give Blade's blood so that they can   unlock the archives, the ancient archives so that they can, the vampires can become daywalkers like Blade.   But this is a action-packed movie and if you like vampires and action-packed and Wesley Snipes, recommend picking up Blade.	1.732
Hello, I'm Matthew and I'm here to give   you my review on   this DVD movie called The Feeding.   It came out in two thousand six and it was directed by Paul Moore.   Besides that I can't tell you the rest of the cast, it really has a bunch of nobodies in it.      The storyline is a bunch of college students go camping in the woods and there is a werewolf which is chasing them.   This is definitely an independent film.   How it got made I don't know.   This movie   was quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen in my life.   But almost to a point that was very funny.   It was shot on a very low budget.   It was shot really kind of grainy.   The acting was horrible in it.   Almost like they were reading cue cards.   The werewolf costume was completely unbelievable.   And   it also had a person in it who kept   shooting the wrong, missing the werewolf when it shot at it and  shooting the college kids. So she ended up killing about four of them because she was such a bad shot.   This movie,   how it got made I don't know.   How it got released on DVD I don't know,   but it was quite comical to watch and   on a scale of one to ten I would probably give it a one.   If you're in for a good laugh, I would go pick it up but I would definitely stay away from it if you like serious good movies.	4.435
Hi.   This is the Nine Inch Nails All That Could Have Been live DVD,   from two thousand.  And if you wanted to check out Nine Inch Nails live,  this is a pretty good representation.   It's from their fragile tour   and it has eighteen songs on here on two discs,   and it has two formats for sound.   I think there's just the normal stereo one and there's a surround   sound as well.   The picture quality's really good.   They also came out with the cd at the same time,   but the cd has I think about fifteen tracks, so this has three more on it.   And I've watched this quite a few times and it doesn't really get   old if you're into Nine Inch Nails you're going to like this for  a while.   And I saw them on the last tour about four times,   and I think this one is entertaining because it has different visuals   and stuff.   So if you've been checking on Nine Inch Nails and you want to see   visually what it's like to be at the show, this is the,   pretty much only DVD out there right now and it's    it's a little expensive.   It's probably about twenty five thirty dollars but it's definitely   worth it.   Thank you.	3.559
This is a review for  Kung Pow   Enter the Fist.    This is a Steve Oederek movie   and  basically what happens in this movie is they've taken an old    seventies  Kung Fu movie and they've redone the dubbing for it.   And they've also inserted new scenes.   And it's actually really funny. If you remember a few years ago when the commercials for this were on,    the commercials made it seem terrible,   and I don't blame most people for not wanting to see it cuz I, it didn't look good.    But what I can say is that the things that were in the commercials were probably the least funny parts of the movie.    It's got lots of like, really stupid humor but it also has a lot of things that just take you off guard like with how  amusing they are.    That being said,   I'm always telling my friends how funny it is and every time I sit down to watch it with them, I find myself be, becoming  intensely embarassed that I find anything in it funny,   and I, I have a really hard time getting through it.   But then later on when I remember back to the movie and all I can remember is it just being absolutely hilarious.    So you may or may not like this    I did.   But I can recommend it, it's a funny movie.	5.477
Hey guys,  I'm going to do a quick review on the movie called Epic Movie.   It's basically a movie  comedy satire    it's it  mocks movies such as the  Da Vinci Code, Nacho Libre, X-Men,    Land of Narnia,    Chocolate Factory,   and some other movies I can't really think of right now.    it it's  a movie that you don't really don't need brains to go watch it.   It's a lot of toilet humor and cheap laughs,   and if you are really really really desperate for that kind of a comedy, I   highly recommend this movie for you.    I mean if you are expecting   a lot more, I mean with this type of movie I   don't think you will enjoy it.    It's,   it's  got a pretty, pretty  low rating  right now, but it's doing very well surprisingly, in the box office.   So if you're really desperate for    I mean, cheap laughs and that sort of    genre movie I would highly recommend    this movie to you.   If you're not in, not into this type of movie, avoid it if you can.	5.972
Hi, I am reviewing the  the movie Borat.    Cut in the full name of the movie is   Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.   And  Borat is a fictional character played by a comedian Sasha Barat Cohen.   And    you know, Sasha Cohen   is the    the main star of the Ali G Show   where he has three personas and basically are this.   He  picks up a character named Borat from Kazakhstan and he    you know, goes through America and plays pranks on    you know, Americans.   And  sort of pretty, pretty funny movie in my opinion.     There are a lot of  questionable acts in the movie, such as a scene where him and  his partner are naked around the hotel.    Upon viewing that in the movie theater  a few people decided to leave.    It's also been  flagged for anti-semitism.   But  to me it's all,   it's all good comedy.    Sasha Cohen is Jewish so you know,   I just find the, his work funny and so do many others and that's why it's made so so  much money.	4.082
Hey guys. I'm going to do the movie called Norbit.   I had a chance to huh catch this movie   on a prerelease screening  last week.  Thank goodness I did not pay for the movie.  It  stars Eddie Murphy. He plays several characters in the movie.  He plays the main character  and he plays    a big  a big obese woman in the character as well and   you know, it's about him trying to win his true love, trying to impress this woman. Which is not that obese  obese woman in the movie that he also plays but   that's another   another actress who portrays his true love in the movie.  I mean after watching   The nutty Professor or Doctor Dolittle   those  movie were tolerable, but this movie was was  just out of the park. When I was watching this movie throughout throughout  in a in a  movie in the theater, I was just going what the heck  am I doing here?   I mean,   the only thing I was impressed with the movie movie  was    the fact that he he  played several different characters   at the same time in the movie.   That was the only thing that I was       you know  impressed with. Other than that the acting was    really really less than mediocre  and the story line is so cliche and you know, so over done.  I mean what happened to Eddie Murphy's    career? I mean this is how low he's gonna go? How low can he sink any further?   I hope he will get better roles    than this movie.   This movie   I mean, if you don't have to pay for the the  movie ticket for this    Norbit, I recommend it.   If not, don't catch it at all. It gets a thumbs down from me.	4.435
This is a review for the movie Legend.    This is the   ultimate edition   DVD.    The director was Ridley Scott   and it starred Tom Cruise   and Mia Sarah.    It's actually kind of an older movie I believe it was back in like   eighty-four or something like that.      This particular DVD set is really cool because it has two different versions of the movie.   Cuz it turns out that the theatrical release for it  had completely different soundtrack   and  there were a lot of scenes cut out of it.   So    this    set, it includes the theatrical release   which we all   grew up on I'm sure. And then    the other DVD is actually the original version  the director's cut   with the original soundtrack and all of the scenes that had been  omitted.   So I think that is totally awesome.    The movie itself is very cool.    It's it's  a fantasy.      It has like unicorns and this big old like,   devil looking dude who is actually Tim Curry,   so that's kind of cool.      It's my favorite movie ever and I recommend it to everyone. {laughter}	6.683
This is a review for the movie AntiTrust.     The main actors in it are Ryan Phillippe, Rachael Leigh Cook, Claire Foriani,   Forlani and Tim Robbins.   If I was a professional reviewer and I had to give this movie  you know a star rating, it would probably be like two out of five.    That being said it's still sort of a fun,    enjoyable movie to watch if you're not terribly concerned with, you know, genius level filmmaking.    It's just,  sort of a fun movie. It kind of takes place where   the main character's sort of, invited to work for    a Microsoft-like company, and  things are all sort of going on    in the company and he discovers it all, and it's sort of like, what happens from there.     You know  it's a, it's a  solid movie. It's rated PG thirteen,    so pretty much anyone can watch it.   It's only about,   just slightly under two hours long. I think about an hour and forty-eight minutes.      But, you know, it's a solid movie that's sort of fun. I wouldn't try to impress anyone with it. It's not, like, great, by any means,  but but  it's okay.	3.559
Hi, how you doing? My name is Roger. I'm going to tell you a little bit about Disney's version of Beauty and the Beast. Now once again this is a Disney movie that they have made quite a few years ago and then they remade it and digitally enhanced it and put it  re-released it back out on DVD. This is the platinum edition which means it has an extra disc on it.   And on this extra disc is just a, a  world full of other  bonus features that you can look at. But getting directly to the movie itself  Beauty and the Beast is just a classic movie that  is great for kids of all ages, it's great for adults,  I mean  it's you know a great movie to watch with your kids, you know, and  it's fun, it's enjoyable, it's a lot of, it's really it's  a musical. It's got a lot of singing in it.  And you know I'm not real big on musicals but I'll tell you it has a lot of fun songs, it's got a lot of silly things in it,  it's got a few lines in there that are memorable, that you kind of recite back over and over again just because it's they they're  fun and and  silly lines.  But it's a good movie. It's a fun movie to watch  like I said  with your children of all ages they'll enjoy because the animation is geared down to  that level but, you know, at at  a younger child's level but also as  for an adult it's even enjoyable there.   So, you know, if you're looking for a good movie that you want to have your kids look at or  even to show as a family, you know, Beauty and the Beast is a great movie to watch.  Now I'll tell you the the  special edition which is what this is, I don't even know if it's still available out on the on the  shelves because Disney does release things then pull them back off the shelf for a while and re-release it again.  But this has, you know, couple of different   versions of the film on it.  It's got a experiential DVD which you put in your computer so that you can play some games and do things like that with it if that's what  to kind of get your whole Beauty and the Beast experience. But if nothing else, okay, at least go to the, go to the  store if you have never seen this movie.  Go, go  and   go to the rental place or wherever you may go and rent Disney's Beauty and the Beast and watch it with your kids. It's a great movie. Thanks.	4.435
This is Bruce Campbell versus the Army Of Darkness   the boomstick edition.   Now,   this is a two disc set set  the details, the actual, the original movie   in widescreen, in full screen,    and it also has the original ending the    it's dubbed the apocalypse ending.   That  that was actually cut out of the original feature because it was too much of a downer   and was  replaced with the S mart ending.    I'm not gonna go into any more detail about them cuz   just see it for yourself, they're good stuff.   Army of Darkness is all,    the follow up to Evil Dead Two, Dead By Dawn.    It actually follows after the movie, which is more I can say than Evil Dead and Evil Dead Two which was just a remake.      But  Army of Darkness   follows right where Evil Dead Two left off, in    Ash going through the portal and ending up in another time frame.   Now   in this movie,   he is     first believed to be   a soldier for the red army.    Eric the red and   those types you know.   And    and after proving his worth, which comes to a very,   very cool sequence   with  some very cheesy theatrics,      he    he convinces them that he's the chosen one that's written of in the in the  necronomicon,   which is actually what he's sent to acquire.   Now from this point,   many things go wrong.    He finds himself fighting against himself.      He finds himself fighting the  the origins of the deadites, where all those zombies actually came from.   Where they were birthed. And   of course he fight against the army of darkness which we'll see how that comes together.      This movie is basically it it  departs from the,   from the horror ideals that the whole series started with,   and moves onto a straight   action adventure comedy.   Which  works out pretty well.   And    it, it     has its  exciting moments,   it has its funny moments and it has its straight up weird moments.   So    Army of Darkness.   Boomstick edition with the director's cut and special commentaries and TV spots and all kinds of other features that    I don't have time to list now,   so just go ahead and pick this up.	4.243
This is Donnie Darko. The two disc special edition director's cut. This movie's about, I believe,    about twenty, thirty minutes longer than the original cut.   It it  goes into some extra plot elements. This is actually movie the way it was  intended to be shown.  I was actually first  exposed to this through this very recently and I have to say that    I like psychological movies, this is definitely a psychological movie except it goes more, like, it doesn't just go over the deep end, it hangs from it below and just kind of leaves you there wondering what's going on, what's happening, how is this happening, what are they, what is what is  he doing, how is he doing this, you know? Like all these questions will run through your head but it slowly educates you on how things are going on and what what's  going on. {cough} This movie basically starts off with the idea where   Donnie, the character played by Jake Gyllenhaal, is  he he  is leaving his house late at night. It's like he's sleepwalking and waking up in the middle of nowhere and one  at one point when he does this a   plane engine falls through the roof and hits his room, but he wasn't there. And according to this  the movie this  spurs on a chain of events where   time splits. That's all I'm really going to say because the movie can  explain this so much better than I can but   that's where the introduction of  Frank the Bunny comes in. You know, so that element how do you explain? See a lot about this movie is things you're not supposed to understand until you get into it, so there's not really much I can tell you except for this movie will leave you questioning everything up until the end. And then  you might have one question on your mind, like I still have  the one question on mine but I'm not going to ask it because it will ruin it for you but if  if you think about this movie too much you'll start asking the same question. So   watch this movie.   It's very good.   If you like psychological  sci-fi then this will be it. And it also has Patrick Swayze in it as a   as a  the Jimmy Swaggert type in every way, shape, and form. Enjoy.	5.354
Hey, y'all, how's it going? My name is Jordan, and  today I'm gonna be reviewing the DVD Godzilla.   Now, this movie  well  if you saw it,   then you probably don't need to watch any more of this review.    The movie kind of speaks for itself.    It's not really a great movie. Matthew Perry   is actually Not Matthew Perry. What's his name? I think his name is Matthew Perry.      Matthew Perry.   I think his name's Matthew Perry. It's the guy from Ferris Bueller's Day Off. I think his name is Matthew Perry. I'm pretty sure.      Yeah.   He's the guy    who's the big hero in the movie,   and   I don't think that he could really be a hero in a movie.    He wasn't very good    at you know trying to solve the big problems or anything like that.   The effects in this movie were not that great. This was actually   after Jurassic Park came out and  in this movie,   the effects look worse than Jurassic Park, so people went expecting,   you know,      you know, effects that would actually look better, but no, they didn't look nearly as good as Jurassic Park.    It actually looked kind of similar, it looks like they kind of copied some of the stuff from Jurassic Park,   but    as far as special features go, I mean it has a little bit of special features. Not a whole lot,   but it has like how they created you know, some of the    some of the character,   you know, CGI stuff, and everything like that, and how they destroyed a lot of the buildings and stuff like that,   but I mean,   the movie kind of just   isn't that great, so I mean you probably don't wanna pick this DVD up because    the movie's not that great, so you won't be that interested in the special features, so    I'd skip over this one   and  look for another one. So that's it.	4.435
Hey y'all how's it going my name is Jordan and  today I'm gonna be reviewing the DVD Mona Lisa Smile.   Now    guys if you ever hear that your girlfriend or your wife or whatever   wants to watch this movie,   run in the opposite direction as fast as you can.   Because this   is not what guys wanna watch. That's for sure. This movie is no good if you're a guy,   and for sure if you're a bunch of guys and you're gonna sit around and watch your movie.   This is one you definitely wanna skip over, I'm pretty sure   that you could tell just by the cover   that this is probably one that you don't wanna watch with all the guys on football night or something like that.   You definitely wanna skip over this one.   Girls though, you're gonna like this a lot.    Everything I've heard from all the girls that I've talked to they really liked this movie.    I mean   I've seen it, it was okay,   I just didn't really get into it at all. But I mean I wasn't really expected to.   But  it has Julia Roberts in it and a few other    actresses and I mean it, it's  an okay movie, Julia Roberts is a good actress.       But really this is a movie for girls,   and so girls y'all are really gonna want pick this up, guys you are gonna wanna skip over this definitely.      As far as the special features go it doesn't have a whole lot of stuff,   it has few galleries because this movie has a lot of art in it,  as in like paintings and stuff like that.   It also has like a gallery where you can go through and look at the    the different paintings that they studied    in the movie like in their class.    So yeah, so I guess the special features are okay but again you're not gonna find them interesting unless you find the movie interesting and I just didn't find the movie interesting at all.   So you'll probably not even care about that if you're a guy.   But if you're a girl   you're really gonna like this. So this might be a good purchase for you.    But go out there and rent it first for sure.   And  guys just just  skip over it completely.   But  but yes, so that's Mona Lisa Smile.    Guys don't get it, girls,   think about it.	6.055
Hello, I'm here to tell you about this  crazy movie Sasquatch Mountain.  This was just released recently. It was made for Sci-Fi.    This movie pretty much reeked.   It has the typical Sci-Fi story line where they're out in the woods and  there's monsters  killing them one by one and  you know. The typical Sci-Fi channel movie.    This movie was just pretty corny. The graphics are bad and   everything, the acting. I think there's maybe one or two good actors in this movie that are in some other  popular movies. But this movie  really stunk and it's not really that entertaining. I don't really recommend you watch it, but if you wanna make fun of it then I'd watch it.  But you can get this anywhere and it's probably about  fifteen dollars, ten dollars  and  I guess watch it and see for yourself.	3.742
Hello, I'm Matthew, and I'm here to tell you about this DVD and it's called Ultraviolet.  This is a science-fiction movie made by the same director of the movie Equilibrium, which was an excellent movie. I had high expectations,   because this was, like I said, from the same director of Equilibrium and I was   very disappointed.   It's a sci-fi movie but it's very confusing, very choppy,  it's kind of corny too. And it stars the same girl that was in    The Fifth Element and Resident Evil.  The only redeeming thing about this movie is probably the actress that's in it.  She wears very little clothing and that's probably the only redeeming quality, is seeing her run around in  belly shirts. But this is a horrible movie. I would stay clear of it and I would not recommend this movie.	4.69
I'm doing my review on Pink Floyd The Wall featuring Bob Geldof and it is rated R for adult content, nudity   profanity, and whatever else you could imagine. You have to at least watch this movie one time in a life, you know. It's   just   an really strange movie. You probably even have to watch it as many as three times to figure out half of it.   I would say that all in all, you would just have to see it to believe it. It's very    it's set I guess where a person is on drugs  and, in the trance or daydreaming or all of the above and it's about the adventures or daydreams or activities in a person's mind   that they would dream about under the influence of drugs and it's really wild because you just could not believe half the things that happened to the guy.   So, I would recommend watching it, in moderation.	2.828
Napoleon Dynamite.   If you don't, and you haven't heard of this movie, I don't know where you've been living. Maybe in a friggin rock because Napoleon Dynamite is, I almost wanna say a cult classic. Yeah, originally bought by MTV and     when MTV's scouting for new and upcoming films they wanna present, Napoleon Dynamite was found.    They tell you about it in the extras of this DVD, so it's a great way to find out about the history and how Napoleon Dynamite came to be.  So I don't need to go into depth about what Napoleon Dynamite's about because    you should already know.   My lips hurt real bad, can I have some of your chap stick?  Or  give me some your tots. Or  Sweet. Or, well you get the point. Eat your food Tina.  Gosh.  Just some imitations of Napoleon Dynamite if that's what you want. Because if you wanna laugh and you wanna just see just an idiot up there. You want a movie to quote or if you never understood the quotes coming from Napoleon Dynamite, and maybe you feel left out, then   you gotta see this movie and maybe you won't feel so left out when people talk about sweet Napoleon jokes, alright?  Gosh.	5.0
This   is Bruce Campbell Versus Army of Darkness  the Director's Cut Official Bootleg Edition.  Now  this is probably the worst cut of this movie I've ever seen. It just doesn't sit right with me.   It has about fifteen minutes of extra deleted material,    which was deleted for a reason. It's just  it's alright, it just doesn't, it's not necessary.   The thing that really bothers me about this cut is the editing. It doesn't give you an option as to which ending you see, you're stuck with the apocalyptic ending.  Where if you like that ending then you're probably good with this.  But I really didn't like the apocalyptic ending, it just left me disappointed. But    if you saw the movie, you know what I'm talking about. If you didn't, you'll have to see it to understand. But     this       it just      it's just  not a good cut. It's just cause of whoever put in deleted scenes, they're grainy.   Like if you're gonna if you're gonna  do a director's cut where you put in deleted scenes, at least   make them  look as nice as the rest of the movie you know?  Because then it just kind of detracts from what you're watching.   Okay so I will explain the movie now so I got that out of the way.   Bruce Campbell reprises his role as Ash in the third installment of the Evil Dead series, though this is Army of Darkness, not exactly Evil Dead.    It's more of an a action comedy than  any of the other ones were horror. It's more of a an action oriented    one liner spouting hero    has is  trapped seven hundred years in the past and in order to get out, he has to find, of course, the Necronomicon.  And   and many hijinx ensue  with his search for the Necronomicon  and   the resolutions afterwards.  What goes on afterwards.    But    he ends up obviously   having to take on the army of darkness.   The thing is though that there's several freight, he's in medieval time basically.   Very arcane,    non-technological, but it still goes with the idea that     That   he  somehow has the knowledge to     create and build whatever he wants out of what he can find.   That's interesting, but for that you'd wanna see a different edition of this movie, but not this one.	5.0
This is Evil Dead Two: Dead by Dawn.  Directed by Sam Raimi and of course starring Bruce Campbell  with supporting cast Sarah Berry, Dan Hicks, Kassie Wesley, and Richard Domeier.    This movie is kind of a, it's kind of disappointing because it's a more comedic version of the first movie.  What they actually did was  after making Evil Dead the success it was they were actually given a larger budget and  they decided to make  do a remake of the first album, err the first  the first movie, sorry. Do a remake of the first movie but the way they wanted to do it, the way they had actually envisioned it to be when they originally conceptualizing doing the original movie but couldn't afford to do it.   This movie is more comedic than anything. It's not really scary  at any point it's just kind of labeled horror because that was the intent. But    this movie throws in  more sets,  more things involved, more people involved. Basically  Bruce Campbell's character Ash is taking his girlfriend up to a cabin  to get away and   basically have a good time. And of course  the Necronomicon is found.  Pages of it are  missing.   But  the person who actually owns the cabin has  passed down the pages to someone who's actually going to the cabin to study them. Now  this throws in  more supporting characters that show up along the way, our guides of the person of the daughter of the of the  archaeologist, or whatever you'd call the person who is studying the book. And    and of course this brings about like the same in the first movie. Pages of the book are read, Ash has to face the zombie threat.  It  it uses different  different ways of facing  them this time and there's actually a point where Ash's own hand gets possessed. How that gets resolved is actually excellent.  This isn't a horror movie, it's just a remaking of the first one but it's still something to watch, it's still a pretty good movie and it's great for a lot of laughs and especially drinking games. So  go ahead and pick up Evil Dead Two: Dead by Dawn, starring Bruce Campbell.	5.0
Nine Inch Nails And All That Could Have Been Live.    It's basically a  live compilation, well not really a compilation, it's a concert of theirs   where they play a lot of the new songs from the fragile and many of the classics from   pretty eight machine, broken, and the downward spiral.    So there's there's  a good, it's basically the nine inch nails version of the greatest hits.      It has  a lot of the favorites like  closer, head like a hole.   If you were in the broke, into the broken album, it has wish, gave up, , it has a lot, it also  has  sin and all those, all the  songs that were considered great of the nine inch nails time, all the singles,   but with this, this is the    the deluxe two disk edition so it has this nice    {noise}  this nice little clothy, fibrous    outer case and then you got the maxi pack that you always come in, nine inch nails seems to love to use,  with the  nice little booklet here with the artwork from the fragile    different art work that wouldn't have made it.   And then  you got your two disks,   one of which is the live concert and the other one is called still.   It has  piano, acoustic guitar and vocal.  Some drums of some, like some original nine inch nail songs as well as some newer ones like  something I can never have from pretty hate machine, it was pretty much guitar and synth song    now it's simplified even further to drums,   piano,   vocals,   some acoustic guitar.   It also has the fragile which is actually a pretty complex arrangement than the original    simplified down.   And then there's also   the title track and all that could have been,   which is actually probably the best nine inch nail song I have ever heard that was actually released.   I've heard a couple unreleased songs from the pretty hate machine time that were just awesome  but those don't really count considering they were never released  but    and all that could have been,   live compilation,   some  subtle,    some subtle remixes and remakes of some prior tracks as well as some new compositions.    Very good stuff.   It will give you a good    crash course in the history of nine inch nails if you have never heard of them before,   just go ahead and pick it up and listen through if you find things you like, find out what album it's from and there you go.	6.055
Hi, my name is Anaj and today I'm reviewing the movie Boxing Helena.   It's a psychological thriller, if you haven't watched it it's a nice movie.  It's about this doctor who's kind of psychologically   crazy. He's really generous, you know, really rich, but he wants this girl who's kind of a seductress and  well the movie's R rated. It has some  adult scenes in it with them. And  it's an alright movie, I didn't like the acting of the guy  Julian Sands and Sherilyn Fenn so the acting was just alright.  A onetime movie, definitely not my type though. It it  is a thriller   he wants this woman, the woman is you know  not interested in the guy so he finds a   , I won't tell the story but he gets possession of this girl and then tries to take care and win her heart over, but    the story's  related to that. Watch this movie  one time see, not bad. DVD  I'm not sure if you'd want it in your collection, I won't suggest it though.  Not many special features either.  It's more of an artsy kind of movie than a real thriller and  xxx rate it two out of five and  this is a review of the DVD of Boxing Helena.	4.082
I'm reviewing the dvd Chasing Liberty.   Chasing Liberty is about a girl named Anna who is the president's only daughter.    Anna is tired of always being followed around by secret service agents and she really wants to have some fun and   enjoy her freedom before she goes to college.   While she's on a trip with her parents she meets a boy and they sneak off and travel all over Europe together,   and eventually she finds out that   the boy had been lying to her all this time and he was really a secret service agent himself.   So by this time Anna has of course fallen in love with him.   But after some ups and downs she eventually gets over the fact that he lied to her and realizes that he really did love her.    This wasn't a horrible movie, it was just too much like every other teenage romantic movie.   If you like chick flicks it's pretty good, the actors and actresses aren't bad and the storyline is kind of cute.   But it was just kind of cliche.   But if you're looking for a cute chick flick you'd probably enjoy Chasing Liberty.	4.69
Hello, this is It's a Wonderful Life on DVD.   This is the Frank Capra Christmas classic that everyone sees every Christmas.   I've had this on tape, two or three times and I finally   burned all those out from watching it so much and now I have it on   DVD. This truly is a classic, classic movie and everyone needs to see this.   Of course the story follows a man who's at the end of his rope and wishes he was never born.   And an angel  grants that wish so that they can see   how George Bailey, that's  Jimmy Stewart's character,    reacts when he finds out what wouldn't or what would not have happened if he had never been on the earth and it is a classic storyline. This edition has been completely remastered.   It now has a THX certification for sound, and the   video itself is very crisp and clear and it's been brightened up and remastered like you have not seen this ever from me, it says it's just like it was when it was originally made.   I really appreciate the fact that it's very bright and clear because this movie really deserves all    everything they can do to it. It is a timeless classic.  It comes out every Christmas for me and I think it should be part of your Christmas   movie list, too, it's Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life on DVD.	3.697
Hi, today I'm going to be reviewing a dvd.   Two Weeks Notice.    Starring Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant.    This is the widescreen edition   and  it's PG-thirteen and it has a hundred-and-two minutes.    And it doesn't have any extra features   I mean,    not many ex, not many  extra features.    It's got the movie, visit the stars,    the making of, it got two additional scenes, so    but it doesn't have any bloopers or anything.    And    not many {sigh} extra  footage that you haven't already seen if you've seen this movie.    But other than that, mainly about the dvd because of the movie.    It's a pretty good movie    I'm a fan of Sandra Bullock.   And    this is      another one of her good movies that she did    it's about    he's a,    he's,  she goes to work for him.   And  they clash and   things happen  don't want to give it away.   But    it's a good movie, it's kind of like a romance   comedy movie.    I'm not sure if guys will like it but.   If you're a girl you'll probably like this movie.   Check it out.	2.16
Hi. This movie that I'm going to review for you is the new movie Borat that recently just came out on DVD. This movie stars Sacha Baron Cohen and he plays the character called Borat who is supposed to be a man from the country Kazakhstan who has come to America to make a documentary about American life and American customs.    But   the movie is really Sacha Baron Cohen dressed up as this character going around America and  interviewing real people basically, and getting their responses to somebody kind of   from a different culture,  more of a third world country. It's  kind of   he portrays Kazakhstan as a country, you know, where women are pretty degraded and    they don't really have cars and    running water. It's pretty third world but the movie is absolutely hilarious. Especially people's real life reactions to this    to Sacha Baron Cohen playing this character.   And throughout the movie he, Borat, the character,  becomes obsessed with Pamela Anderson and so that's when he decides that he wants to go from New York City to California  to meet Pamela Anderson and marry her. So it's basically Borat going across the country talking to different people, going to different social events, from New York all the way to California  and it is really, really funny. And I think that if you have a good sense of humor you should watch it because you won't be able to stop laughing.	3.873
Hi, today I'm going to be reviewing the movie MouseHunt.   It's supposedly the funniest movie of the year, it says on the DVD. It stars Nathan Lane and Lee Evans.      It's  PG, and it's about an hour and thirty minutes.    It has some special features on the DVD of    production notes, cast and filmmaker's biographies and stuff.   Not too much, but   the movie itself      is okay.      Well, it's supposed to be the funniest movie of the year, but {sigh} I don't really think that's true.   It's kind of one of those silly type of funny movies.    So I don't know if you enjoy that.    I tend not to like those {noise} type of movies, because I don't know, they're not really funny to me.  But, if you wanna check it out, it's okay to see maybe once or twice. It's MouseHunt.	2.16
Oh boy, this one is bad. It's    Covert One: The Hades Factor.   It's  based on a series of silly    FBI, CIA kind of government secret agent novels.   This one's called The Hades Factor. It's about    the disease that's starting to breakout and    this agent has to discover the source before it breaks out everywhere and kills millions of people. It stars    Mira Sorvino and Stephen Dorff.   The movie unfortunately goes on and on and on. It feels like it's never gonna end and that's not helped by the fact that it's over two and a half hours long. I think it actually comes in at almost two hours and forty-five minutes.   Do yourself a favor, don't watch this.   There's no reason to sit through three hours of bad movie.    You could maybe fast forward through it, but there's no point.	3.786
Do you know what the number is?   Three hundred. It's three zero zero. Now   let me tell you why three hundred's a good number. Three-hundred's a great number because  the Spartans  dominate in this movie. It  I   I  heard plenty of things, I don't normally go to the movies, I go to the Lord of the Rings, big movies. So I wanted to see this one just because I'd heard so much about it,  from friends. And they didn't ruin it for me, I mean, given if you already know the story  it's not ruining it for you. They die in the end, if you're familiar with the story so I'm not really ruining anything for you.  It's based off the graphic, kind of like,  back in the day tales. But anyways  this movie blew me away. I am very into film,  I have a camera and, obviously I'm filming on it now it's right there. But I like to edit, and I have my own video editing business and this movie absolutely blew me away.  If you are a man or  even if you're a woman like,   like  I mean given it's mainly action, it's not much of a love story so much as like, you know, Titanic, {sigh}   I was so impressed, I was blown away and the entire night afterwards. I saw it in IMAX. Screen was six stories high by eighty feet and that's half a football field, and  it was crystal clear and I was absolutely in awe. I definitely recommend seeing, it if not in an IMAX, just anywhere. Please go see Three hundred. It's probably the best movie I've seen in a long time.  Have a good day.	6.403
Hello there. My name is Adam and  right now I am going to review the movie called Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.    This movie is directed by Ang Lee.  It was released  few years ago I guess now  and    it's got  some interesting  special effects, a lot of  wired effects where people are flying around and that and    it was  as you can see in the front here, winner of four academy awards. It was very   well reviewed and liked by the critics.  The  DVD itself has a lot of special features on it.    It's got a lot of behind the scenes things and all that.    I will be perfectly honest though,  I didn't really find this movie that interesting, I found it hard to follow what was going on,   and    it just wasn't my cup of tea at all.  I would probably give it maybe    at best a two out of five,  you know, because it's    international film, you know,  so give you a little bit of different culture  which I get is, is  you know kinda interesting, but    I  probably wouldn't recommend people going to see this. It's    a renting. It's not,   not  that great but,  anyways that's my opinion on Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.	4.69
Hi, today I'm presenting   a movie opinion on   the movie Employee of the Month.    This movie is starring Dane Cook and Jessica Simpson.   It also has Andy Dick in it.    I would give this movie about a five out of ten.    The acting wasn't any particularly very good and   it wasn't very funny, it's supposed to be a comedy.   I would say it's for  people between the ages of about   thirteen to twenty-five in that range.    It had its moments but for the most part it's just one of those    stupid comedies    it's about a employee   of this like, store who    does slacks off a lot and    this really pretty girl, Jessica Simpson,   who moves to the store and he finds out that she really likes employees of the month.   So he starts out working really hard trying to get employee of the month so he can   win the girl. And   so he runs and he also has an, an  enemy in the store who's also trying to get employee of the month   and so they fight over the position.   And so it's kind of entertaining but I wouldn't recommend watching it unless you're pretty bored.   So,   Employee of the Month.	5.354
Hi, today I'm presenting a movie opinion on a movie that's in theaters right now called   The Hills Have Eyes Two.    I thought this movie was really, really bad.    It's supposed to be scary and stuff, but I didn't really feel scared, it was just like   a lot of goriness and stuff to it.    I didn't really like the acting, I didn't really know anybody that was in it, so    I thought it would be scary  the previews made it look like that but it really wasn't.    It's about these like,    like  training guys that are  in the desert and on their last day they get attacked by these mutants.    They're national guard trainees, and  I don't think like it's not very good, it's not very gore, like the goriness sucks, the acting sucks,    the storyline sucks, it's just like one of those like,    like,   there it's like a typical horror film that they tried to make scary and stuff but I didn't really feel   like it was like that at all. It was just bad and a waste of money, so don't go see The Hills Have Eyes Two.	5.354
Hi, today I'm presenting the movie Pride, which is playing in theaters right now.   It has  Tom Arnold,    Bernie Mac and a guy named  Terrance Howard.   I'm not really sure who he is,  but he's the lead actor.   It's about this guy who starts, finds kind of like this abandon pool, and starts like a    swimming team for troubled youth and    I would not recommend this movie. It was absolutely terrible. The acting was terrible. It wasn't very good at all. It would just be a waste of money.   It also got terrible reviews from professional critics as well.   I don't know why I went to go see it.   I thought it looked interesting.    But yeah, it's a terrible terrible movie and it's a waste of time.   It's not a very like, the story line wasn't very good and    the acting seemed kind of corny. The lines they used like, doesn't really seem like real life stuff.   They tried to make it like   inspirational kind of thing but not really. So  I wouldn't recommend going to see Pride.	4.967
Hi. I'm reviewing the   DVD release of Basic. It stars  John Travolta and Samuel Jackson. It's  a military movie.   John Travolta is sent to, to  investigate the disappearance of Samuel Jackson who's  a disliked drill sergeant.  They think he's too tough on the recruits and they think that he may have gotten some of them killed.  I did not care for this movie at all.   The twists and the turns weren't really   inspired or creative or  even interesting. It just seemed like they came up with random things to happen that   I don't know. It just, by the time you get to the end of the movie it felt like a waste of time to have watched any of it.  The ending was pretty silly, in my opinion and    overall I would have to say this was a pretty poor movie, and the DVD is also pretty poor with  nothing more than a couple small featurettes for special features.	5.416
I've got to wonder   who out there is   watching Steven Seagall movies. I mean obviously I watched this because   I hate myself.   But    somebody out there   has to be buying these   and  actually enjoying them,   so that they continue to buy more of them because he keeps on making movies and I can't figure it out because   they're terrible.   And    I have to actually restrain myself   on the couch   before I put the movie    on play to watch it because otherwise   I just end up throwing whatever I can find at the tv   in an effort to   break it whatever,   his smug fat face comes on the camera.    I guess I should get to the point this movie Black Dawn,    he plays a ex-CIA agent,    has to    stop terrorists from releasing a nuclear weapon.    It sounds like a million other movies and it's just like a million other movies   except somehow worse.	3.559
I'm   sitting here trying to  figure out if I've ever seen a Wesley Snipes movie that I enjoyed.   I guess the answer is probably no, because   this is maybe the  one of the worst movies I've seen him in so far, and that's saying a lot for  Wesley Snipes. This movie is called The Marksman, this is the DVD release.  It's ninety-five minutes long. There are no special features on here at all.   It is high-def but   doesn't matter, it's a bad movie.   He plays a special forces soldier who has to go stop Russian terrorists at a nuclear power plant and    there, you've seen the whole movie.       Like I said, there's no special features on here.  I really didn't care that much because I wouldn't have wanted to see them anyway, but  this movie is just a real stinker.  Stay away from it.	4.69
Hi I'm reviewing   Postmortem.   Starring    Charlie Sheen      I guess now he's trying to take himself seriously since the box says,   Charles Sheen,   but    this is not a movie I would pick   if I was   Charles Sheen   to launch my serious movie career.      In the movie he plays   a  serial killer profiler.   Which there are a million of in movies.   And he retires to become a novelist but he moves to a small town   to get away from it all and it turns out that the small town has a serial killer so he has to   help track him down.    It's   not    a very good movie.   I didn't enjoy watching it,   there's no special features.    So it's a pretty poor DVD.      Overall   I really can't say anything positive about this, I wouldn't recommend watching it.    I actually think it went straight to DVD.   So if you see it   on the shelf, just go ahead and avoid it.	4.082
Hi, I'm reviewing the DVD release of , Python.    , If you've seen Lake Placid, or Anaconda, or any of those,  this is basically just a,   a rip-off of those.    And, , since it's ripping of a couple of pretty poor movies,   it's probably no surprise that this one's even worse.    , The first thing going against it is that there stars Casper Van Dien,   who in my opinion, has never been good in anything except for maybe Starship Troopers.    , There's no special features on the disc.     Which may be a blessing because once the movies over you wouldn't want to see anymore anyway.    But, , this movie   is basically about an hour and a half of ,   poorly done special effects.   A computer generated snake   chasing around  man and naked girls.    I know that sounds good but  it's not.     Basically this movie is not good,   the DVD is not good, and , I have nothing good to say about it.	5.745
This DVD is entitled  Last to Surrender. It stars Roddy Piper, who a lot of you will remember Roddy Piper was a wrestler for many, many years. He has delved out into doing a few  movies from time to time. Obviously, it's going to be a B movie , cuase like I say, because he used to be a wrestler, so, but he stars in this movie.   He's got a partner. He's a cop. And they have a wild shootout and his  partner is killed. He vows to track down the killer.  He's only known by the name Tiger. So they really don't know much more than that, but,  like I say, he goes through the movie trying to find out his partner's killer. And  if you like Roddy Piper, you'd probably like this movie. If you don't, you probably won't.   But  doesn't really have any special features. It's just the movie itself. And it is a B movie.  I found it to be, you know, and okay movie. But, you know, everybody can judge for themselves. Some people really like B movies. You know, they they  like them better than the  the  best blockbuster movies out there. So you might all just give it a chance and see what you think.	3.559
Okay, I'm going to be reviewing , Star Wars Two Attack of the Clones.    , the  movie, if you guys haven't heard of Star Wars, you guys need to wake up because I think everybody is, on the planet earth has heard of Star Wars.    , but , this , the movies not actually that great,  but I mean, it's Star Wars so you got to get it I guess.     even though the movie isn't all that great.     It has really cool special effects, so, that makes it kind of worthwhile to watch.    And , every once in a while . It's a good , a good  movie that the whole family can watch.   Rated PG, so   little kids as well as adults , can appreciate it.    , This particular DVD   has , the , disc one which has the actual movie on it  as well as , disc two which has special features on it.    Special features include , , deleted scenes, , documentaries,   , teasers and ,  a couple other things.    So you have a whole disc of    special features, but ,   anyway,  Star Wars is just ,  a    , a really good movie,  , so just check it out.	1.414
So the movie I'm going to review for you today is Pretty Woman.   It stars Richard Gere   and Julia Roberts.   And this DVD is the fifteenth anniversary edition,   so it has some extra features on it.   This story   well, this video actually came out in the early nineties and   it's  the story of a girl who is a hooker.   Julia Roberts.   And she gets picked up   by a wealthy man named Richard Gere,   and he doesn't actually plan on      picking up a hooker.    But he does    when he's looking for directions and something happens that both of them  don't expect which is that they fall in love   and    she kind of learns that there's more that she wants to life than being a prostitute.   And he learns that there's more to life than   being a wealthy businessman.   And   I love this movie, it's one of those classic chick flicks.   And    it's just,   oh it makes you another movie that makes you just so happy at the end.    And it's definitely a movie that you should watch with your girlfriends ladies    cuz it's just fun.   So that's Pretty Woman with Richard Gere and Julia Roberts.	3.697
Hey expo tv.   I'm Dea and I watch a lot of movies.   Obviously.   I watch movies for no good reason. It seems interesting enough, I'll watch it.   It seems not interesting at all, I'll still probably watch it if somebody recommends it to me.   It has somebody that I like to watch in it, I'll watch it.    I'm not very picky about these things.   So I went ahead and picked up Gossip.   Actually I think somebody borrowed it, borrowed it to me.   Way to talk the English as well. {laugh}   Somebody let me borrow it. And    interesting movie.   The plot is basically about a couple of journalism students   who as a sociological experiment, decide to start a rumor.   And to track their rumor and to see what goes on how it changes, how it twists, how it turns.   Who it turns on.   {laugh} I didn't mean it in that way. {laugh} Hit the pause.   Anyhow,  James Marsden is in, is in this movie. He's cyclops from X-men, hello.   Norman Reedus is also in here and you got to love him. I'll watch anything he's in.    Kate Hudson is in here, albeit for a few minutes, as is Joshua Jackson.   But this isn't the greatest movie of all time ever.   It, if it's on like sci-fi,   I would say go ahead and watch it with one eye.   But I wouldn't recommend that you go out right now and buy it or you'll die. You'll actually expire from not having it.	6.055
Hello and today I'm going to be reviewing the DVD Serenity.  And  this is "a triumph, a thrillingly original science fiction creation."  So, this is a science fiction DVD. So, it's all, it's for like science fiction lovers, obviously.  And  this takes place in the future and on a space ship, where six rebels are on the run because they have taken in a fugitive.  And this is like, they're sort of trying to protect her from  the relentless totalitarian regime that wants to get her back.  And  how they were trying to help her escape.  And  this is a great movie that actually is from the same  person who did TV's Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  So, there's a lot of explosive battles, a lot of special effects. It's really fantastic. There's a lot of new worlds. It's a really a great adventure. I recommend it for anyone.   It's rated PG thirteen, so it's mostly for teenagers and adults. Little kids probably won't be able to enjoy this so much,  but for  teenagers and adults this is definitely a great movie.  A lot of action, a lot goes on. A lot of adventure. If you love sci-fi you'll probably, definitely love this movie.  And this is a widescreen edition, so a lot of TVs nowadays are widescreen, so having this be a widescreen edition is definitely helpful.  Once again this is the DVD Serenity. I highly recommend this movie. If you're bored or it's a rainy day or, you know, if you just want to watch a movie.	5.354
Hi, I'm here to do a review on The Scorpion King starring, The Rock.  This movie's rated PG-thirteen  It's about a, Cadian dude, or whatever. That's like the last of his kind.  And he's going, and he's a mercenary assassin, back in like a long long time ago  and he's supposed to like, kill these people  but he ends up, he can't   and his two brothers die, so he's going after this king warlord kind of guy  and his whole purpose is to kill this sorceress girl right here  but he can't, he ends up falling in love with her  and she goes with him,   well he kidnapped her, and he ends up meeting up with like the rebels which is that dude right there, the leader   and, they like, end up stopping this evil warlord guy  so, that's why I recommend watching the Scorpion King.	2.38
Hey, what's up? Okay, today I'm going to be reviewing a movie.   This is Nicolas Cage. He's in this movie called Gone in Sixty Seconds. Gone in Sixty Seconds is a remake of a seventies film by the same name   and basically it's about  a car a car  thief gang that has to steal a certain number of cars within a short period of time, and  this movie involves a lot of car chases obviously, and it involves a lot of fast cars, a lot of fancy cars. You'll see lots of Ferraris and Lamborghinis. If you like   if you like that kind of thing then this, this movie could be for you. I was actually disappointed, I was hoping for a lot more, I don't know why. I've been disappointed by Nicolas Cage many times.   Also this is a Jerry Bruckheimer film and   I don't really like Jerry Bruckheimer. I don't think he   I don't think he really cares about making good movies, he cares about making movies that make money. So it's lots of explosions, lots of action, but not necessarily a lot of interesting action. It doesn't always seem motivated   plot wise.   Ultimately  if you haven't seen it, if you haven't seen Gone in Sixty Seconds go rent this original seventies version, you'll probably get more entertainment out of that. I give  the modern Gone in Sixty Seconds  two out of five.   Sorry Nic.	5.26
Hey, how you doing? I'm here now today to review this movie for you. This is Saving Private Ryan starring  Tom Hanks among others. A nice ensemble cast here. Ed Burns, Matt Demon.  This is a world war two epic. You've got   probably the best filmed  scene of the d-day landing on  Omaha and Utah beach ever put to film. Steven Spielberg, this was one of his triumphant moments, and he has a lot of them.    This was also one of the first DVDs  to come out, as I remember. When DVDs first came out this was an early one but it's still a really good, it's a good transfer.  It's   gripping, especially the action sequences. There's  there's a lot of them. A lot of shootouts.   It follows the  path of some American soldiers as they   make their way into Europe and then ultimately find a special mission where they're supposed to go and find Private Ryan. Saving Private Ryan, the name of the movie.   Private Ryan is played by Matt Damon and he is   he's a soldier in Germany who has had all his other brothers were also in the war, but they were all killed. So the American high command decides to pull him back because it wouldn't be fair to his mom to  have them all be killed and he was definitely in the line of fire. So I won't tell you how it ends but     that's part of the story, the main, that's the crux of the story, gets a little cheesy at times. I think Tom Hanks is great in it, he really plays the role of a citizen soldier who is  viscerally torn by  by leading men into combat. Even though he's a great  individual troop commander he is  he is suffering because his men are suffering and they're really his friends. It's hard for him to  separate that from  from being the commander. Often that,   that's  the case with    company commanders. I give  Saving Private Ryan five out of five. I think it's exemplary, one of the best war movies ever made despite the somewhat cheesy plot lines.	5.066
I'm going to be doing a review on Groundhog Day, starring Bill Murray. This I watch every groundhog day, just because  of you know, theme of the movie, but it's just so freaking cool.  Basically it's about a weatherman that has to go do a a  show  little thing for  the news station on the groundhog coming out, whether he'd see his shadow or not. And I guess he has done it for a few years, and he just doesn't want to do it this year so he goes into it just kind of like bored and blah, whatever.  And as he goes through the day all he wants to do is just get home, he  there's supposed to be a supposed blizzard coming. He doesn't think there's gonna be a blizzard, and which he says on the weather show before he goes on this trip  and so when he   as the day's going through, you know,  at the end of the day they're on their way home and there's a blizzard coming. He's like nah, it's impossible, you know, for a blizzard to come. So they have to go back, he's got to stay the night in this, in this  town,   and when he wakes up the morning  he hears the same song he heard the previous day, he's thinking okay,   that's kind of odd, and then he hears the guys talking about it's going to be cold today and, and you know he's like okay and he, you know, it all sounds familiar. So when he gets outside he finds out wait,  it's groundhog day again? I got to give, you know, another interview on the groundhog? And so he's kind of confused like what's going on? So then, you know, he goes through it and he's just kind of lost, but as  the movie progresses  he finds out that every day he wakes up to the same day. Same song, same everything. So he tries to find different things to do throughout the day cause  he, you know, he feels like he's just trapped in this weird Twilight Zone type of world so what he does is he just he just  starts doing different things. It's a pretty cool movie, I love this movie. If you haven't seen it yet,   go watch it. I give it a five out of five stars.	5.416
This is the movie Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid.   I really couldn't watch the whole show,   but basically it's about  the blood orchid is a rare flower  and it holds the secret to eternal life and they start to , you know they go into the jungles to find, to hunt for it.   And of course they, the  stories about an  anaconda and so you they find this giant anaconda that   was in the movie and I couldn't even stand to look at it. So  I didn't watch the whole show but if you are afraid of snakes or anything you'd probably have your eyes closed the whole movie so I I  didn't like it. Just looking at this cover with the snake on it I don't like it. Anyways this is   let me see if they have any special features. The special features are deleted scenes, previews, and , and the making of the feature so. All of the actors are   let's see  Johnny Mess, Messner    KaDee Strickland, Matthew Marsden, Eugene Bird, Salli Richardson-Whitfield, Nicholas Gonzalaz.  Those are are the actors. And so  yeah if you don't like snakes then you probably should not waste your time  watching this.	2.517
Hey how's it going? I'm Pat and I'm reviewing the movie Rounders.  Now   it's funny.   With Rounders, a lot of people think I look like Edward Norton. I actually don't think I look like him at all, but some people do. Edward Norton is a great actor. He's in this movie Rounders. Rounders is about    a couple guys that are incredibly good at poker that try to swindle a lot of people at getting money  where    Edward Norton plays a character that just gets out of jail, has to pay a lot of gambling debts and Matt Damon's character has to come in  and do all this rounding which is playing poker and getting money from all these people to to   pay off his debt. There's some swings, there's some swings back and forth. And    eventually, you know, it's actually a very good movie. Especially if you're an avid poker player because  there's a lot of different poker things. Poker topics that happen in this movie.   It's one of my favorites.    It's a very funny movie. Lot of twists and turns.   You know, again, if you're really into poker, it's a very good time.   Matt Damon's pretty good in the movie. He's a good actor, and so is  Edward Norton.    I just love the movie.	5.477
Hey everyone, what's up I'm Pat and I'm reviewing the movie   Club Dread.  Club Dread  I mean, it was pretty much a huge disappointment.  Still kind of funny   but   if you, if you've  heard of the movie Super Troopers   basically it has the exact same cast as that movie.   This movie  is the same same  people. It's supposed to be kind of like a Super Troopers two, except having nothing to do with that movie. It's you know the next in line of that comedy team, The Broken Lizard.  But   I mean it it's it's it's  an okay movie, it's kinda funny.   But I mean, the thing is to compare it to Super Troopers, which you're supposed to  it's it's  there's no comparison. Super Troopers is just much better.   This movie just  it was kind of kind of a disappointment.   I don't even know really why I, I  bought it because I hadn't seen it in theaters and I knew who was in it so I was like, it's gotta be good.  Meh   I'd stick to Super Troopers if I were you. If you have that movie in your library, watch that and then just assume that this movie's okay. No real need to see it, I wouldn't really recommend it too much.	6.055
Hey how you doing. I'm gonna tell you a little bit about this movie called The Karate Kid II.    This is the same characters that was in Karate Kid I which is great because it's always good to have a sequel that has the same characters so that things just keep carrying and basically the ploy behind this one is    obviously  Pat Morita has taught Daniel here how to do karate and they've won some contests, all that happened in Karate Kid one.   Well in Karate Kid II,   Miyagi now takes Daniel over to Japan, over to Okinawa and from there they kind of get mixed up into a old life, you know, life long family feud. and it's the just the drama brings out from there.   But you know, I mean it's it's  okay for a sequel.    It's not that great but it's it's  okay. I wouldn't wouldn't  really run out and get it. But if you're able to get you know, all three of em. But you gotta see the first one before you see the second one, okay. This is one of those times that you need to see em in order, because it makes a lot better sense. But    it is rated PG because it does deal with fighting and there is fighting, there's karate and those things do happen.   So take, but take a look at it. It's called Karate Kid II and it stars Pat Morita and like I said it's a pretty good movie.   You know, you know  it's still a family type movie and it'd be good for the family to see it.   You know   just kind of you know, I'm not really completely sold on it. It's not as good as the  as good as the first one, but it does carry on with the story, okay.   It actually even says it, the story continues. It just kind of carries on where the story left off, okay. But take a look at The Karate Kid II. Thanks.	4.69
Hey, how you doing? My name is Roger. I want to tell you  a little bit about this movie called The Karate Kid III. Okay? Yes, that's right, part III. They have continued making these sequels to The Karate Kid. Now, the first movie was great. It had  Pat Marita and Ralph Macchio, and it was Daniel-san and his sensei, Myagi, and it was about how they first met, how they  fought,  I mean, how he taught him how, Myagi taught Daniel how to do karate.  The second one was, you know, took it down the next road, where they went to, back to  Okinawa and, you know,  Myagi, they got hooked up in some kind of feud. Well, the third one here  with the same characters, which is good because it has the same exact characters, it just keeps going on and on,  it talks about this feud. Now Myagi and Daniel are kind of on opposite ends.  Daniel wants Myagi to help him get ready for a tournament and  Myagi doesn't want to do it. So it's it's  about them being on opposite ends. And the guy who Daniel ended up going to is an old nemesis of Myagi's, and so you got that drama there. Okay?  But it's just it's just  not as good as the originals.  the original Karate Kid. But I'll tell you, I mean, if you're watching them, you might as well go ahead and see the, you know, all of the Karate Kids as they go into it. But it is  you know, it does star the same people. It is rated PG because it's dealing with fighting and karate and things like that. But it's it's it's  worth just taking a look if there's no other thing out there to watch and you've, you  get the whole set. Okay? Just so you can kind of see it.  But, like I said, the farther down you go on the sequels, they don't quite get as good as the first one was. But  The Karate Kid III, starring,  you know, Ralph Macchio and Pat Marita,  go take a look at it if you wanted to move, keep on moving down The Karate Kid road. Okay. Thanks.	3.416
The Hills Have Eyes Two. I enjoyed The Hills Have Eyes, the remake that came out a couple years ago and   this is the sequel to it, of course.    Going into the movie I knew the plot. You know, it's the hills have eyes, the first the one the family gets trapped, stays in the hills,    which used to be,   they used to test nuclear weapons there. Some of the people stayed, they killed the people, and that's what happens. So in this one it's    the same premise, nuclear testing still going on the grounds. This time the army goes in there to test weapons and    they go in there to to  do stuff, they have    workers and stuff go in there, and .   So if you saw The Hills Have Eyes One you're probably thinking why not add soldiers? But   it was it was a bad movie. it wasn't the worst movie, and on a scale of one to ten I'd say it was probably a three.   But it was, it was  bad. I knew it was going to be bad. I wanted to see it just to see it. But I knew going in it was going to be bad and it wasn't as bad as I thought it was gonna be.    It was still pretty bad, you know? Most of the people in the movie I didn't know.    A couple of the people I did, I knew who they were, but    it  was a very bad movie.  Like I said, nuclear testing and then  the army goes in to to  do stuff and then   most of them get killed. I mean, that's the premise of the movie and  it's terrible, definitely stay away from it.	5.598
Hello again. This is the Derek, this time with another DVD review   and this one is one of  I mean come on if you were ever a teenage boy or  in the eighties or nineties or even nowadays,   every party has a little  bit of a nerd, you will love Rush,   the rock band Rush. This is a concert  DVD that came out.   It's a double disk  Rush R30, so their thirtieth anniversary world tour,   has a DVD one is one entire huge concert live that pretty well plays   every one of their hits  including most of the twenty-one twelve  over  their   to  all some some  new ones like earthshine.    spanning thirty years of their career of such a phenomenal band  that, that  really is more influential to rock  and than than   so many other bands out there, I mean there are still going today.   The second disk has a bunch of interviews with them, it has a vault of other, you know, music videos and some more live performances.  But one of the special things for this whole box set is really when you open it up,   it has such a beautiful presentation to any fan   that shows you  a retrospective of the the years, has a  a live CD over here so you can listen to the live concert in your car,   has the two disks,   it also has  some  autographed  guitar picks. They are not really autographed by they have their signatures on them from Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson   and also has a  great little booklet of photos with      other   trinkets it thrown in like stickers,   and a replica of a backstage pass   so you can pretend that you were ever at one of these concerts.  It's a great  box set, amazingly good sound,  lots of easter eggs on here, they even say on the back good luck finding them,  but I can't recommend it better if you are a fan to listen to one of their greater concerts that they have put on a long time in adobe five point one audio.   I definitely pick it up if you are a fan, if you just are a kid today and want to know what a great rock band out there is still living and, and working and breathing sounds like you know, pick it up and check it out.  Thank you.	6.403
Today, I'm reviewing Event Horizon. This is the  the special collector's edition. It stars  Laurence Fishburne, Kevin Costner, and  also Joely Richardson, who is  the who stars in  Nip Tuck, which is a great show.   Event Horizon it's a really cool concept actually event horizon's actually   the point in space in which you can't get sucked or which outside of you cannot get sucked in to a black hole. So it's basically the  the furtherest extent of a black hole. It's kind of a sphere.   So it's a really cool concept in terms of the  the science behind it and then, you know, what happens if you were to get closer.    But it's just, it's just  a really gross movie. It's one of those movies that like it's scary movie, too.    But it's real gross. There's just nasty blood and guts and  disgusting things hanging out all over this spaceship that basically goes to an alternate dimension, or hell, and then comes back and then these people go and try to rescue it because they think it's been a long lost  spaceship.   So, I wouldn't really  recommend this movie. I don't think it was very good. You shouldn't waste your time with it.	5.196
Hey, how you doing? My name is Roger. I want to tell you a little bit about this    movie   called the Master of Disguise. Now I will you that this is probably one of the biggest wastes of ninety minutes that I've ever done in my life. This is one of the most stupidest movies,      and it was a complete    insult for me to even watch it. It was that dumb. So I will tell you   don't bother. If you see it keep walking by. Now Dana Carvey, I mean he's the, you know  it's, he's the main guy in the movie. Now I I  used to watch him on Saturday Night Live and, you know, it was funny. But in this movie he's a detective and he's in all, he goes in all kinds of different disguises to to to  do  to to to  go after the bad guy, I can't remember exactly, I don't even remember why he's going after him. I just remember it was just so ridiculously stupid.  I mean there's some stupid funny movies out there but this      I mean it it  you had to have the maturity of maybe a five year old to really, really think this is a funny movie. So I will tell you  Dana Carvey's Master of Disguise, if you see it just keep right on going. It's not worth the ten dollars, it's not worth the five dollars. If someone gives you the movie it's not worth the time to even watch it. So don't even think about it, don't look at the name of it except the fact of saying ooh never get that movie. Okay, thanks.	5.354
Hi.   the product that I'm going to review today is the movie by Stiven Spielborg,  instead, Steven Spielberg. {laughs}  It's called Innerspace.    this stars   Dennis Quaid, Martin Short, and Meg Ryan.   It's a comedy, a romantic comedy about a     a guy,  Dennis Quaid, who gets  shrunk  in a machine, and he was initially supposed to be injected to into a science rabbit.   it was an experiment that they were doing.  Instead something happened and ,  I believe the science lab where they were   starting this experiment was broken into at the time   by another corporation or another  guy who wanted to  steal this information before   Dennis Quaid and his team could  complete the mission.   And  what happens is that  one of the scientists that has Dennis Quaid in, injection needle runs off and then somehow injects Dennis Quaid and his machine into Martin Short,   and   it's just a story of how they tried to save  Dennis Quaid  from  dying inside of Martin Short's body.  It's   It's  funnier {laughs}   then what I'm actually telling you.   But  I  I definitely recommend this movie. You can find it at Amazon dot com or D DVD  Discounts for under twenty dollars.	4.546
I'm doing a review for the movie Ghost Rider starring Nicolas Cage and Eva Mendes.    This was probably the worst Marvel movie I have ever seen.    It's even better than Dare , or even worse than Daredevil I mean. I actually liked Daredevil a little bit, but this was just awful.   It stars Cage as the Ghost Rider, a supernatural    bounty hunter of the devil, who has to go and chase another bad guy called Black Heart  before he can collect souls and become super powerful.   The story was really boring.   It didn't go anywhere for a long time.   The special effects were pretty good, I'll give them that.   Watching  Nicolas Cage transform into the Ghost Rider and back, seeing his flesh peel away, things like that. It was cool to see that.   But other than that there weren't many positives in this movie.   It was just, I was just waiting for this movie to be over it was so boring.   Eva Mendes can't really act well, but she is extremely easy on the eyes. So if you need an excuse to see that movie  fellas, that's one. Other than that, I would suggest avoiding it at pretty much all costs.	6.055
Hi,  today the product that I'm going to review is called  Mister and Misses Smith.   And this story in or, the movie sorry {laugh}    some of the actors that play are Carol Lombard and Robert Montgomery.   And this dvd is about    a couple who are married   and    come to find out  that there was something wrong with   the marriage license in the town where they got married.   Something about their marriage wasn't legal,  and it,   it's about how    they separate.   And   he,  Mister Smith is trying to win his   wife's   affection again and try to get remarried, it.   It's funnier than {laugh} what I'm saying, it really is.  I'm not sure how best to describe it, but it's a hilarious movie. This is    probably the nineteen forties or ninteen fifties version.   I believe there was an earlier version with Cary Grant .   And it, this one is in color   and it's a great movie for people who love old classics and comedy classics.   You can find this on amazon dot com for under twenty dollars.	1.915
Hi.  Today the product that I'm going to review is a VHS  called Mrs. Winterbourne. This stars Shirley MacLaine, Ricki Lake, and then Brendan Fraser. This story  is about a young girl, Connie, and  played by Ricki Lake, of course. She is from the  poor side of the {laugh} street. She's poor. And  she runs away from her family, or her father and goes out to New York, falls for a not-so-nice guy and  winds up getting pregnant and  the guy kicks her out. And so she leaves him and  it follows her life as she is mistaken for another young lady who was married to Brendan Fraser's twin brother.   And  it follows her as she goes through trying to pretend that she is this other girl. And it it's  a great movie. You can also find this in DVD or VHS on Amazon dot com for under twenty dollars.	2.944
Hi. I'm here reviewing Borat, the movie    based on the Borat actor from the Ali G. show.  I found this movie to be just so ridiculously hilarious  that I think any fan of  the Ali G. show just has to buy this DVD. Anyone who's not a fan of  the Ali G. show, I think they'll still love this movie. It was, like, it's so ridiculous, all,  almost all of it was unscripted.   And it was just Sasha Baron Cohen in character going around basically messing with people. He got sued by a bunch of people,  just to show how real this movie was.   There are just some things that, like, you do not expect half of this movie. Like, it just comes out of nowhere and is just hilarious.  They do some ridiculous things. The actual  DVD cover, it has, like, and English slip-on. When you take that off, everything is in Russian.  And  it looks like it's a bootleg DVD. If you look over here, it looks like the actual cover is just a bent-up piece of paper. The actual DVD looks like it's a burnt disc. And it says "Demorez". "Is life? No. Is Demerez."  It's  making fun of Memorex because their slogan is "Is it live or is it Memorex?" So I thought that was just really well done. It says "Borat" in Cyrillic letters over here.  And there's a bunch of extra features, such as  deleted scenes,  a bunch of other things. And all of that was hilarious. The actual DVD menu is written in broken English and just done like as if it was bootlegged.  Yeah, so I'm definitely giving this a five out of five. Everyone should buy this.	7.0
Hi, I'm here with The Matrix Revolutions.   This is the final movie in the Matrix Trilogy.   I'm giving this movie a two out of five. I love the first Matrix, the second Matrix had amazing action and special effects and I liked it too. However I did not like this third movie. I felt they could have ended the trilogy so much better. Almost the entire movie was like    two battles. One in the real world and one in the matrix  and  it  didn't feel like that much happened in this movie. The movie just felt like really short and  the ending just wasn't that good. The dialogue was pretty bad. Keanu Reeves Keanu Reaves' acting was like a lot worse than the first two movies.  He has a lot of one-liners and he's confused a lot of the movie.   {clears throat}   He  doesn't show a lot of emotion.   There's this one fight with Neo and Agent Smith that like  there was like a billion Agent Smiths but he only fought one so it was kind of disappointing cause I I  thought it would be a crazy fight with every Agent Smith against Neo, but no, it was just one.   And that fight was kind of disappointing. It was basically a rip-off of Dragon Ball Z.   The DVD has some extra features, some behind the scenes stuff but I don't think that makes it worth buying.    If you watch the first movies you should get  rent this movie just to watch it but I do not recommend anyone buying this. xxxx	5.598
I'm reviewing Enough starring Jennifer Lopez. This is a really good movie. It's a  action packed, it's suspenseful,   it's a little sad.  It's  dramatic.    This is a a  good movie for, you know,  like if you're just   wanting to  have a night, a quiet night, you know, you can get this movie and watch it and it'll empower you, it's it's  an empowering movie. But it's  rated PG-thirteen.  I guess it would be okay for children to watch but probably not, I mean, you know. You would want to watch this alone.   But  it's got special features such as digitally mastered audio  anamorphic video,  widescreen and fullscreen presentations. So that's good cause  if you don't like widescreen you can get fullscreen, if you don't like fullscreen you can get widescreen. But  it's got   it's also got Juliette Lewis in here.  You know her from Cape Fear. But it says right here Everyone has a limit.  This is the thriller of the year, Ari Fishbach at Fox All Access Countdown. But this is a good movie.  Jennifer Lopez is really popular right now so, you know, this movie is still good.   But  the approximate run time is, let's see,   let's see what is it,  oh it's a hundred and sixteen minutes. But  you can find this at Amazon dot com for under fifteen dollars or you could go to Sonypictures dot com and find this also. But  this a good movie. It's an empowering   assertive women movie.	3.559
I'm reviewing The Italian Job  dvd. It's full screen collection.   It's got Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron and Edward Norton.   It's two thumbs two thumbs  up says Ebert and Roeper.    Full throttle entertainment says    Thelma Adams of the US Weekly.    It's    oh, approximately a hundred-and-ten minutes, it's rated PG thirteen.   It's got special features,    it's got you know, the making of it, theatrical trailers, it's got deleted scenes.   It's got  English and French subtitles.   And    but this movie is a action packed movie, it's got some good stars in here,   and  you know Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron they're both really popular. And Edward Nort Edward Norton is also popular.   But  I recommend this movie.   it's it's  a good, it's even got Seth Green in there. And he's a, he's a  good actor.   But this movie is a good movie, it's so. I wouldn't I wouldn't  let kids see it, you know.   But    adult, you know, if you get a free night with your husband, watch it.  It's fun, it's a good movie and it's fun it keep you interested.	3.367
Today I'm reviewing Office Space, it's the special edition with flair.   And it is from creator Mike Judge    as I said earlier it's a special edition you get a lot of extra bonus features.    Special features include out of the office it's an all new office space    retrospective with writer and director Mike Judge.   Eight never before seen deleted scenes. It has a DVD-ROM content office space audio clips and screen savers, and it also contains the original theatrical trailer which is nice.    This is a really good movie, it's very very funny,    Dolby digital, you can you know have it in Spanish also and then in French in closed caption.    It is eighty-nine minutes long.   You can also get it subtitled in English and in Spanish so if you can't hear well you can you know, read it.    And then it is also rated R for language and brief sexuality. Office Space is a really funny movie if you haven't seen it I don't know where in the heck you've been the last couple years.    It's a great movie and the cast is extremely funny.    I would highly recommend that you pick up Office Space,    watch it this is definitely something that you want to add to your DVD library.	3.873
Hi, this is Dan with my review of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. This one by far is my favorite of the Indiana Jones trilogy and it  introduces a new character,  Sean Connery, Indy's dad and    by far the  best written   script of the three Indiana Jones' in my opinion. The Last Crusade details    Indy's quest for the Holy Grail, the chalice that reportedly Jesus drank out of that will bring immortal life.   It is a little farfetched, but this one's well played.   and I felt that this was the best written of the three Indiana Jones movies.   This is a great film. It's safe for the family, I believe it's rated PG and    it is rated PG-thirteen. There is some violence now that I do remember that involves a little bit of    gore. People's heads being decapitated rolling around and what not. Definitely touching experience,    as there's more dramatic elements in this movie. As well as the same    humor and also action found on the frequent  Indiana Jones adventures.   Definitely not one to miss, I would highly recommend it and this is Dan with my review of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.	5.972
This is a review of the dvd movie   Gosford Park.  It came out in two thousand one on USA Films, also on Universal.  {laugh}   I'm not gonna lie I saw the previews for this movie   in two thousand one when it came out.   For some reason I had thought that this was going to be like  like a horror movie and people were going to be like getting killed in this house and it was going to be really sweet.   And I always like it had been a movie in the back of my head that I'd been wanting to rent or buy for a long time.   And I rent movies online and I put, {laugh}   put it in my list and sure enough I get it and it is nothing like that. It's like an old stool like    you know like a murder theme mystery in someone's house.  with like British accent people, English accents. And    I don't know, I, it definitely seemed more like a B film to me.   I wasn't too impressed.  Even like the cover like makes you think it's gonna be like some xxx nation like wrong turn, I don't know some sort of horror movie or something. And   this really wasn't. I wasn't too impressed I hardly watched any of it and  I was kind of let down,  I thought the original previews in two thousand really led me astray and then I rewatched    one on the internet  today right,    right as I was watching it and it {laugh} seemed a lot different so I don't know maybe there's another Gosford Park out there but this Gosford Park is sure not    a horror movie, so    don't rent it.   If you're looking for a horror movie.   At all.	4.435
Hi, ExpoTV. This is user QTPie here. And I'm reviewing a movie many of you have probably heard of before or maybe seen. It is a movie based off of a TV show, Jackass The Movie.  This is probably one of my favorite movies. It's absolutely hilarious.  It's easily in my top ten. This is the special collector's edition in widescreen.    Basically, what this show is is a group of guys go out, cause trouble, and  do skits  on people.  It's pretty funny.    This is what the disc looks like. It's got the  Jackass skull and  what is this called again? Crutches, the skull and crutches.    Some of my favorite scenes in this is  probably the off road tattoo, which is where Steve-O goes into a Humvee off road and gets a tattoo while they're going over all these huge bumps. And also   another hilarious one is  Steve-O puts a  bottle rocket  in his in his  butt crack and  shoots that off and he gets burnt really bad.    It's not a movie for children. It's rated R.  It's got dangerous stunts and  a lot of language and nudity. So it's really not for kids and if you insist on having a kid watch it, you should probably have a parent present.    Anyways, Jackass The Movie, special collector's edition, I really recommend it.	4.082
Hi my name's Cort and today I'm going to review the movie Toy Story Two  which is obviously the sequel to Toy Story.  it's a   Pixar Animation Studios  production and also a  Walt Disney Pictures production. The running time on this is stated to be ninety-two minutes and it's rated G for general audience.   if you've seen the first one,    just an amazing, the first one was very good and if you think well they probably couldn't top that or do any better, this one is  as good or better than the first one. A really good movie. Very good  plot, very  creative.   again they've got the voice talents of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are in there. They've also got     the guy that plays Frasier who I can't think of right off off of    offhand but  in there as well. And  just a great  great movie.    creativity wise it's just  an adventure. The kids just love it. My kids have probably seen this twenty times.  Buzz here is their favorite character in the world. And  just  a neat neat movie.  one that the whole family can watch together and the adults will probably like it if more more  if not, as much I should say if not more, than the kids do. Just an awesome movie and    very, very well done. So I would highly recommend Toy Story Two and Toy Story One for that matter.	6.683
Hi everyone, today I'm gonna go over this DVD called Legend.  It's a very old dvd   this movie came out   probably over   twenty years ago and it has Tom Cruise in it he looks super young, he looks like a baby like probably like eighteen years old, it's one of his first films.    It's basically a DVD about   these characters  mystical kind of characters like   elves and princesses and    a demon that's trying to take over the world and   Tom Cruise pretty much comes and saves the day.   It's a pretty fun movie to watch, especially if you're into that kind of stuff or into those kinds of stories or films.   It's a old movie but it has really good graphics and really good scenes.    There's also a love story behind it, so   definitely check it out if you're looking for a interesting new different kind of movie to watch. And it's called Legend   starring Tom Cruise. Thanks.	4.83

This is the platinum edition, it's a two-disc special feature.     This is a great DVD. Actually, it's one of the greatest, one of the greatest cartoons ever made. It's got a great score, it's got a great story.   It's a classic. I mean you've got some great comedy, you know, great songs xxx. Of course it's rated G so the whole family can enjoy it.

You get some extra music, you get a Celine Dion video, you get never before seen footage, you get   a video game on there, you get   all types of good stuff. Commentaries.   I would definitely recommend this, like I said, it's one of the classics.   And I would definitely give this one five out of five stars.	4.69
I'm doing a review on the movie Beer League.    This movie is rated R.    , This is the two disc  collectors edition  xxx, of one hundred and forty-five minutes of unrated bonus features.    , this is overall a pretty good movie. It stars Artie Lange as well as  Ralph Macchio.   I liked it, I mean, it wasn't what I expected, but I mean it was a pretty good movie,   it was a comedy.     The movie is about a bunch of guys that , hang out at this bar,   and they play on the same ball team.     The softball team they play on is ,  the beer league.    It's In the beer league. They play ,   play teams from different bars and stuff.     They are a bunch of misfits ,  and I mean they do everything from fight to a bunch of stuff at the, at the  games.    But , this one team ,  you know, ends up,  you know realizing, hey, what are we doing, you know,   and they have a,   a mission to win.     because, you know, one of the guys ends up running, falling in love with this girl or you know,   and he wants to impress her so he,  he  has a change of heart and you know, wants to win.    If you want to find out if they win and what happens I recommend you picking this movie up.    Again this movie is Beer League.	1.915
Hi, I'm going to review for you today the movie Pan's Labyrinth, which is still in theaters.   This, I had no idea when I went to go see this movie, I I  didn't know anything about it really.   I was just going with some friends and    you know, went in and    I guess, it it  has elements of fantasy and is kind of like an Alice in Wonderland story.   And by the end of the movie I I  love this movie. It's it's  great. It was really good.   It's, it's  got like   It's pretty dark I guess. It's kind of scary in some points. It's not really a kids movie.    But the main, you know, plot is that this girl   just   uses uses  her imagination to escape where she is.    And you know, and and  like meets all these magical creatures that are really cool. Like, I hadn't, I really haven't seen most of these creatures like in other movies and stories.   At least the way they're portrayed here, you know. The the  creatures themselves have been in myth, in  mythical stories a lot but like, I really like the way that they're they're shown in this movie.  The story itself is really good. The ending's pretty sad. I really liked it though.   If you're looking for a pretty interesting movie, I'd definitely recommend  Pan's Labyrinth.	4.655
Hi, I'm gonna talk about the movie called Three Hundred which has been a hit in  movie theaters recently.    This movie is just really amazing, it's it's  about the conflicts between Athens and Sparta back in the days.    I've actually recently taken taken  a Greek civilizations class and   one of the interesting things I found was that   though the storyline  is not very accurate and everything,   the weapons actually are very, very accurate and because it is a movie with a lot of fighting and everything, it's    really interesting to see that    this some of it was actually  really true. But other than that   it's really, really an exciting movie it's just all this fighting and three hundred against a thousand and   so many different things and it's just got some classic lines in there it's really a boy movie actually though.    All the guys I know like actually love that movie but    it's not really girl movie it's just got a lot of violence not much of a plot but it's just love the movie it's just a really good movie  I definitely would recommend it    to everybody who likes this sort of thing and who's heard of it and who thinks it's interesting. It's definitely worth it.    I definitely say, suggest you go out to theaters right now and  watch that movie.	4.546
This is a review for the movie Pathfinder.  What Pathfinder's about is   it's about before America was discovered by  Christopher Columbus it was discovered by vikings. And it tells the story of   some vikings that came to  America around the Canadian area. And for some reason they left, and they left behind one of their kids and the kid got picked up by Indians and he was raised by Indians. Then like twenty years later the vikings come back to to  take over the land and the kid has, is now a grown up and he's part of the  Indian culture and he's going to stop the vikings from taking over the Americas and ruling them and killing them all cause they're very savage people. And they're very big monstrous creatures in the movie.  It's a terrible, this is a terrible movie. I do not recommend you go see this because it's awful. It's full of cliches, it's got a stupid love story in it like everything in theaters now. And it's just ridiculous.  I wanted  the fricking bad guy to die the entire movie, I wanted the good guy to die, I wanted everybody to just die so it would be over and I wouldn't have to listen to it anymore or watch it. I was falling asleep half the way  and it was ridiculous because  ticket prices are so expensive so I don't recommend you see this. If you really, really want to see it rent it with like Netflix or something so you don't have to pay for it. It's terrible, I don't recommend it. It's called Pathfinder, so avoid this.   It's in theaters.   Don't go see it.	7.0
Hi, this is a review for the movie Hot Fuzz, now in theaters.  Wow  This is a hilarious movie. I strongly recommend it. It's made by the same people that made the  movie Shaun of the Dead. It's the same actors, they wrote the Shaun of the Dead and they wrote this one.   Wow, it's great. It's it's  a comedy and it's also  a bad ass cop movie.   Pretty much anything you would want to see in a super action packed cop movie, it's in there and it's also full of great humor. You know, making fun of stuff.  And   It's it's  great. The acting's good in it,   it's funny, it's got you know  lots of action, lots of good stuff.  If you like cop movies and you like comedies and you liked the movie Shaun of the Dead,  I strongly recommend you go see Hot Fuzz, now in theaters.  Thank you very much  and  go to the movie, right now. Go to the movie. Go to the movie. Go to the movie. Go to the movie.   Okay, go to the movie.	4.69
This is Matrix, the original, and this is an awesome show. I don't know how many times I went to the theater to see this.   I was going to the theater every chance I could all by myself, just sitting there, sometimes I was the only one in the theater watching it.   You know, it's just, it's such, the visuals was just so, so new and and  different when it first came out and the story line was really intriguing to me and I would sit there and try to, you know, just   figure things out and think about it and just I loved watching the visuals. And    this stars Keanu Reeves and Lawrence  Fishburne and   it's about Neo who's a a  computer genius and   it's also about a world that is really not what people think it is and  it's a whole scheme by these powerful machines to make people think that they're living their lives, but they're not. And so it's a really interesting story and this DVD has , let's see, I don't think it has that many features really.    It has behind the scenes.   It has   music track of the follow the right rabbit and take the red pills   and  it says here "For mysterious mind-bending extras".   I don't know what that means, I haven't watched that.    There's an exclusive chatroom with celebrity guests and other special events. So this movie was an hour and thirty-six minutes but if you haven't watched this first one you ought to watch it. I mean I can, I can  still watch it but now I have to watch it, I I  mean  I have to watch it every, you know, once a year maybe. But {clears throat} the other part two and part three {clears throat} kind of ruined it for me.   So but I really like this, the original. The Matrix. You can get it at Amazon dot com.	4.243
Hi, my name is Wayne and today I'm going to be reviewing this product. It's a  movie that was directed by  Quentin Tarantino. It's called Pulp Fiction.  Specifically this is the collector's edition.  This is a really good movie. It's  loaded with famous actors and actresses.    It's got a great story line and basically if you've ever seen any kind of  Tarantino flick,    you know his style and how gory he is and how kind of messed up he is, but it's really just genius directing and he's my favorite  director.  He also makes guest appearances in all of his movies,  and he does so in this one. But the story centers around  kind of two boss, you know, hit men for their boss.  The boss is Marsellus Wallace who's  played by Ving Rhames.  And the two hit men are    Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta.  They're all after  Bruce Willis who plays a boxer  who bet on his own fight and had a deal and then broke it to make money for himself. So the whole movie has all these individual stories tying together. You know what I'm talking about if you've seen like Kill Bills or anything like that with the way Tarantino does his directing. But it's a fantastic movie, lots of good action. You'll find yourself quoting it because there's a ton of good lines in it and a lot of good dialogue. So I recommend you see Pulp Fiction.	4.967
Hey what's up you guys. So right now I'm here to review the movie three hundred and holy crap was it amazing. I totally loved it.   It was definitely one of the most action packed movies I've seen in a really really long time, and I mean a really long time. Maybe like, you know, past year year and a half.    I love the movie Troy, I don't know if you remember that or not but it was a really good movie.   And that used to be one of my favorite fighting movies up until three hundred, and three hundred to be honest was like Troy on steroids. It was that great. I, I fell in love with it. Like, I watched it like two times in like   the week it came out it was so good.   And   like it has so much action. The graphics you know I don't remember if you remember the movie Sin City or not but    it's that kind of    that's how it looks. That's all you gotta know. I guess a new age of    movie making    technology. And but like yeah, that makes it all look better. It just makes it, the colors were different. They were kinda, I don't know, I don't know how to describe it. But yeah, you have to take a look for yourself. But  honestly the plot was amazing, the graphics, the fighting scenes were the best.   Everything like just, I totally loved it. The acting was amazing too. It was that great.   I can't even like you know, describe to you how great it was.   But yeah, so you should definitely go see the movie. You'd love it, especially guys. I don't know if girls would like it that much but guys would definitely love it, trust me.  So yeah, go check out three hundred.	6.403
Doing a review on the movie Lilo and Stitch. It's Walt Disney.  this movie is rated PG. This is a great movie.    has some great animation in it as well as storytelling.    Has some crazy characters, Lilo and Stitch.    Stitch is an alien from    from outer space  from a different world. And then I mean you got  Lilo which  is a young girl and  she ends up  happening along  Stitch.  they go on some fun adventures  do some crazy things, Stitch and his    does some, you know, mischievous stuff. But I do recommend picking this up. It does have some   funny stuff  it's a good movie for kids.  this DVD does have a a  lot of bonus features on it.  there's deleted scenes,    there's     music   stuff about hawaii on here, a game. Bunch of other things on here so I do recommend picking it up at your local video store. Again that's Lilo and Stitch.	1.732
This is Message in a Bottle with Kevin Costner and Robert, Robin Wright Penn. Robin is the main character.  The movie starts out when she's walking along the beach and she finds a message in a bottle.  The message is basically a love note   to a girl named Catherine and  the note just blows her mind. She   she brings it back to where she works,  a newspaper company, and everyone really wants to know who this guy is, he's just basically pouring his love out to Catherine.   So they end up tracking this guy down, and   Robin really wants to meet him, she's divorced, she's kind of looking for love herself  so  she finds him and they start dating, she finds out that Catherine was his wife that had died two years ago, and he's still very much in love with her.  He's still  very, very depressed that she had died and   so it's hard that they're dating but  because he's still very much involved with the idea of his wife, but   it's a very tragic ending and  very touching movie.	3.742
Hi. This is my review of the movie Music and Lyrics.     I   rented this the other day from Blockbuster and   my mom described this movie as cheesy   to me   and basically I would say that sums the movie up like  cheesy. It's just   one of those really cheesy movies    basically   Hugh Grant is this former like eighties pop star who was really popular in the eighties and    they   start doing some battle of the    like battle of the not bands but that kind of deal, battle of the pop stars from the eighties    to kinda bring back some of the eighties stars   and    I guess in the process of that,  this like,  current     like a Britney Spears or       that type of person basically  is wanting Hugh Grant to write a song for her  she actually has several   like husband artists    kind of competing to write a song for her and so   the only problem is that Hugh Grant   is while he's a good singer and everything, he's not the one who always wrote the lyrics to the song, he had someone else in his band do that  but the band,   like he's not in speaking terms with the guy who normally write these lyrics so now he's in trouble because he can't write lyrics.   And then enter Drew Barrymore, his   actually apparently, this plant lady, she is hired to take care of his plants  and so she,   just happens to be this really awesome writer, she had written children's story or something like that   and so,   she  writes, helps him write this song and    of course   pop star, the current pop star loves it and so,   she uses it and blah blah blah and it's just really really cheesy.   And of course because,   you know, like all cheesy movies, these two fall in love, Drew Barrymore and Hugh Grant fall in love and  it's just a cheesy cheesy movie.   I really don't recommend it   unless you're just looking for a way to waste an hour and a half and then you know ,   you might like it but  I was pretty disappointed in it,   at least I knew going into it was going to be pretty cheesy because my mom had warned me so   yeah I wasn't like oh really disappointed but still.  So I would give this movie two out of five stars.   So   thank you.	4.243
Hi, I'm Jodi and I'm here to tell you about the movie Ray.  It's an  extraordinary great movie.    I didn't know he's such a womanizer   but he's still good, and it teaches, it shows how he   became blind and  how his childhood was and how he learned to listen  instead of walking with a cane he learned how to listen to his footsteps  and where he was by the sounds of the  floorboards,  and stuff so that was kind of neat.  Jamie Fox did a really good job I was impressed.    It's two hours and thirty-three minutes long which it's really worth to watch it, I liked it a lot.    It has twenty-five entire minutes of extra additional footage that wasn't  shown in the theaters.    Kind of fun too.   And, it says about his love life and how he, you know, womanized and cheated.   But, I really think you might like it, so I really suggest this, DVD.	2.16
I want to talk to you about Disturbia. This is a new movie    in which a character is confined to his house, he is under house arrest, and his mother takes away his Xboxes and TV as sort of a little bit of additional punishment. So he starts watching out his window, watching people for entertainment until he sees  something that basically  horrifies him. He thinks his neighbor is actually a murderer but there is really nothing that he can do about it because he is under house arrest.  If this plot sounds very familiar I think I saw this movie  many years ago. It actually came out about forty years and it was called A Rear Window and it starred Jimmy Stewart, and he was confined to his house because his leg was broken and in general I think that is a much better movie than the movie I have just seen in theaters.    I kind of felt a little bit cheated because  the plot is  very similar. You know, Jimmy Stewart relies on the people around him and his girlfriend to kind of investigate and figure out what was going on. Saw a lot of the same things happen in this movie and  this movie felt a little bit cheaper. They kind of tried to stylize it a little bit  for the younger audience but in general   I really didn't think it was worth the money. Save your seven bucks, go to the video store, rent A Rear Window, you're going to like that movie a lot much better. I would rather buy that movie,  the Rear Window I mean, than to see this one again. If you do want to see this wait for it to come out on video and rent it, don't buy it. I don't think it's worth it.	3.786
Hello, I'm Ally and I'm here to tell you about this fabulous cartoon.   It is now on DVD which   is very exciting for many Garfield fans. This is   Garfield As Himself,   starring Garfield.    By the famous Jim Davis who   has done these   classic comics for many many years now.    This is great because you get three of the episodes   just on this DVD.    The runtime   is about seventy-three minutes of just pure Garfield.   The three episodes are Here Comes Garfield, where he  has to save Odie from    their neighbor.    Garfield On the Town, where he just   roams around, he meets his long lost mother.   And Garfield Gets A Life, where   he just gets a life.    This is a great classic cartoon.    The fat cat is really entertaining.   He's really funny,   a very dry sense of humor, he picks on Odie.   John has to rescue Odie and get onto Garfield and feed him his lasagna.    If you're a Garfield fan you'll love this I really found it worthy of a purchase.   It's about nine dollars and you can get it anywhere and I highly recommend it.	3.786
Hello, I'm Jodie and I'm here to tell you about the scary movie The Grudge.   It wasn't really scary. It made me jump. I'm scared of anything so it was kind of scary. Has a nice death rattle in it.  {makes noise} over and over and over and over again   and it has some creepy little Asian boy.  Any little kid's creepy to me, like The Omen, my goodness.  Anyway   It's about a house and if you enter the house then     you're kinda doomed I guess. When someone dies and then the grudge of a powerful rage, a curse is left behind and never forgives and never forgets.  It's supposed to be creepy. It wasn't that good of a movie. I really wouldn't suggest it.  It has Sarah Michelle Gellar. She's usually, she's  a good actress in it, I just didn't like the plot.  It is ninety-one minutes long, which is good. It's PG-thirteen, meaning it can't be that scary.     I think this is the   widescreen. Yeah it's the widescreen. It has special special  features and I wouldn't really  wanna watch it. It's not really worth your time.	3.559
Good morning expotv. Today I'm reviewing the Da Vinci code in DVD format, special edition two discs. This is a famous book that was made into a movie authored by Dan Brown. This is a thrilling book and this movie really shows the book. It's not one of those books is a lot better movie,  but this really shows the book and  how much went into this movie is incredible, how detailed it is, the video quality is  it's amazing. Well obviously it is, it was made  like a year ago. This is rated PG-thirteen for some of the   disturbing images and violence. You see someone die, you see someone stabbed with marks all across his chest which is a little violent.   This has Tom Hanks in it who is a great actor.  They definitely picked the  right person to play this. And this is a movie about,   really about religion and how it goes back and it's really interesting. I know it's not real but it's an interesting movie if you're just looking for a good movie to watch with some friends.	6.164
{noise}  This is  Sleepy Hollow starring Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci.  This,  Johnny plays Ichabod Crane.  He is, I guess,  I guess you could call him  a part of xxx of xxx  that it was before his time really.   He is a weird person in his odd, well strange and weird person in this particular boo-boo.  He   he's trying to figure out  who  the headless horseman really is  and  who is going around killing all the people  in this particular movie.  he he  but he don't he don't like the fire bud.  Put it like that.  So this particular movie, you just have to watch it and see how it ends up.  But this particular disc right here has  special features in it.  It has the widescreen version of it, the  enhanced for six by nine.  It also has the interactive media.  You'll have to watch it and see all the special features it has.	2.16
{noise}  This is Dracula.   This is  a DVD movie. And   it's basically about , it's about Dracula and    he goes around killing people and sucking the blood. That kind of thing.  I never really liked this film that much.   it didn't interest me that much.   But  it does have notable actors and it has Winona Ryder, Anthony Hopkins and Keanu Reeves.     This is, it's directed by Francis Ford Coppola.  But, like I said, I never liked it that much.    it's a super good movie.   the only super good movie I have which is kind of weird.   It has a couple special features.   There's wide screen, there's subtitles   you know,   nothing that, that  great, but  Yeah, it's interesting to watch.    There's a few , there's really a couple interesting parts I liked in the movie but overall I didn't like it that much. And    I'd say I'd give it a two out of five.	3.109
Hi, today I'm  reviewing the movie Delta Farce.   I didn't say force, I said farce.   Stars Larry the Cable Guy, Bill Engvall, and D.J. Qualls.   This has got to be the dumbest movie I've ever seen.   There's three   reservists, old time reservists from the south, drunk.   Worthless people.  And they   have their big, get orders to be sent to Iraq.  On their way to Iraq in a plane.  They decide they don't want to sleep on the plane so they go back and sleep in a military jet.  I mean a military jeep.  Well sure enough the jeep gets dropped in the middle of the desert some place. They wake up, and they think they're in Iraq.  But instead they're in Mexico.  So they  start a war in Mexico against some rebels.  It's dumb, it's stupid, it's boring.   A lack of taste,  what other bad words can I think of.   I've never seen a movie like this, I don't want to see another one like it.   So I think they should've dropped the word delta   and just went with the farce. Because it's not a movie, it's a joke.   I watched Larry the Cable Guy shows and they've been   funny and   okay. This is not even  that funny, and it's not even okay. Not gonna even give it an okay rating.   I give Delta Farce exactly what it deserves, a rating of one,  and a thumbs down, ninety-nine. This is a farce.	5.745
Hi everyone today i'm going to give you my Expo review on this DVD called Elf and it stars Will Ferrell.  It's a light comedy about a human that   got raised by elves and than went back to  earth or what not or the city and try to find his dad and bring back Christmas which was kind of lost in the city   It's a really good comedy  it's a Christmas movie but you definitely could watch it when it's not Christmas I watched it in the summer time and it's still really funny   Will Ferrell plays a really good role as this little elf guy  and  there's a few good songs in it  and I kind of like it's not to long it's really easy to watch, it's a little bit over an hour   this is the full screen version but it also comes in a wide screen version  and you can get it at any place that sells DVD's Target or Best Buy it's probably under ten dollars.  So definitely check it out and it's called elf, thanks.	3.559
Hi. This is Dan with my review of Dogville on DVD. Ouch. This movie sucked.  If there was a movie that could be any worse than this, I'd probably call it a play, which is what basically this was as a movie.  It earns a hearty one out of five stars in my opinion, even though it stars a  well known and, I think personally, great actress, Nicole Kidman. I just think the whole setup of Dogville  just, it was weak. It felt like you were looking at Harry Potter's little map, his magic map, with people walking around, and that was the set and that was the whole movie. Yes, we had to actually fast forward this chapter by chapter just to make sure there was never going to be any real scenery or real set to look at. Very disappointing. Dogville , you know from the back of the cover seemed to be kind of interesting, but the way that the screenplay and they set it up basically was a stage act with little more than props as furniture and also black backdrops just to sort of see this whole thing play out.  Never got really into the movie  because it was just so distracting, and not immersive. It felt like you were sitting in a theater and  sort of tricked into it. Especially since it's a movie you know. So   It's rated R. I would not recommend it, especially if you thought it was a movie. Well, it's not even a movie at that. So Dogville, one out of five stars. This is Dan with my review of it.	5.477
Hi this is Dan with my review of Eight Legged Freaks on DVD.   And I hadn't even heard about this movie until I actually saw it on tv once and I thought man,   that is the worst movie I'd ever seen what is it.   And I finally dug it up and discovered   Eight Legged Freaks.   From the producers   of Independence Day and Godzilla.   Independence Day and Godzilla this movie is not. Basically it,    the prime attraction here is that it stars that Dewey guy from,    not Scary Movie but    Scream.   And he is   I think the   cop of a town again.   But the town is basically infested with giant spiders.   Hence the name Eight Legged Freaks and the little boy   who's a little nerdy   and you know, does the science fair thing,  you know, is all of a sudden the master   of all these arachnids that are terrorizing the town.   It's like dead rising,   the computer game, the video game on Xbox three-sixty with the zombies    meets    arachnids, these spiders. And    basically they're all in the mall and these things are attacking and   seriously I thought I was playing a video game.   Definitely not fun when you're not playing a video game and attacking everything yourself,   but watching other people get spun into cocoons, eaten,   and  maybe some of these spiders getting attacked. So,   one out of five stars is my opinion of this movie, do not rent it, do not buy it.   It's rated PG-thirteen for sci-fi violence,   brief sexuality and language.   But definitely not worth your time.   This is Dan and my review of Eight Legged Freaks   on DVD.	6.055
Hi.  Today's product that I'm gonna review is a DVD. It's called Dreamgirls starring Beyonce Knowles, Jennifer Hudson, Jamie Foxx,   several other different famous  people.   But this {clears throat} is the story about  three girls' dreams to become singers  and    it, it  won  some Academy Awards  I don't like this movie.  There's a lot of singing in it, which isn't bad, I love musicals. But    just the whole story line was  I I  didn't care for it.  It was about Jamie Foxx of course played sort of a bad guy who ,  you know, used kind of used  the girls against one another to get rich and  get popular.  And I I  just didn't care for the movie. The whole plot line was    just silly and stupid.   But if you're interested in owning this {laugh}  you can find it on Amazon dot com and even at Walmart or Target for under twenty dollars.	3.416
When I want to go and watch a movie I normally don't look for a Disney film, or a cartoon     I save that for little kids. Since I have no children of my own  I don't find myself enjoying those type of movies, or even seeing them for that matter.   Lilo and Stitch, however, was one that my girlfriend wanted to see.   We went and saw it and it was actually extremely funny {clears throat}  There were a little, a few inside jokes that were    aimed at adults yet still  innocent enough that children would not get the  somewhat matured sense of humor behind them. Lilo and Stitch is about an alien that was created against  interplanetary regulations and doomed to  spend life on , doomed to be destroyed when he escapes and makes it to Earth.   He is deathly afraid of water and so when he gets trapped on Hawaii they find  they think that he's going to be easy to catch.  He finds  his way into a pound and a little girl    Lilo adopts him thinking that he's a dog.   {clears throat}  In it Lilo is a bit of an outcast among the  more popular children and befriends Stitch who is obviously an alien.    It's a very funny film, not just for children either, so I would recommend it.	5.354
This is Blade.   This movie is starring   Wesley Snipes.   It's about a man   that is   a vampire pretty much.   And   he's not what you consider one of them   I don't know, full vampires.   Because he don't go around drinking people blood.   Matter of fact he go around fighting actual vampires.   He is not getting his blood from sucking people's   necks and all that stuff and killing folks or whatever you do. Whatever they do.   He actually gets his from a little   he he  got some kind of special stuff that he use.   So he don't have to do all that.   And he has, he meets this girl   that   is kind of I don't know,   taking an interest   to his life a little.   And  trying to figure out what the deal is.   And she get involved with him   and they, have she have to   he , you have to watch the movie   to see how they end up.	2.0
Hello, I'm Sean and I'm here to tell you about the movie Hot Fuzz.   I went to go see this in theaters. It is a hilarious movie. It is made by the stars, a lot of the same people, that were in Shawn of the Dead.   The premise of this movie is one of the characters is a constable in London and he has the highest ratings out of any of the police force in London and he's really cracking down on crime.  He's making everyone else look bad in the London police force, so they send him off to a small village to boost the London police force numbers so he won't be making everyone else look bad.   He gets sent to this small village, which at first he absolutely despises   and  it is a very quaint little village   and it's one village of the year several times.  But this village has one of the highest accident rates that you've ever, that you've ever  heard of,  especially in Great Britain   and he goes on to start investigating all these accidents and that's the premise of the movie. It was a hilarious movie. The last twenty to thirty minutes of the movie I had a huge smile on my face. It just made me giggle like a little girl.   But anyways, it's a it's a  great movie, you should definitely check it out.	5.354
This is Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest.   This is the second   movie in the Pirates trilogy now.    It stars Johnny Depp, Orland  Bloom and Keira Knightley.    This continues the tale of captain Jack Sparrow   and Will Turner.    They meet some very new interesting  characters   in this edition.   So if I'd recommend that if you've seen the first one and you enjoyed it then you probably will also like the second one.   So you should check it out, especially now that the third one is coming out on the movie.   So you should probably see this before you see that.   This movie is rated  PG-thirteen,  so it may be a little   advanced for some young children.  But that is your decision.  This movie was made by Walt Disney Pictures, so if you like Disney movies, especially if you're a little older and you still want to see a good Disney movie,  then Pirates of the Caribbean is a good choice for you.  So if you have seen the first one, then you should check out Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest.	3.162
Hi today I'm going to be reviewing   Jerry Maguire starring Tom Cruise.    It's also costarring Cuba Gooding junior and    Renee Zellweger.    So this movie's about a  sports agent named Jerry Maguire.   And he's kind of a, a  bigshot    but he ends up losing one of his  premier athletes to  a different   agent and then he  kind of goes against company policy, leaves it behind and goes    becomes an independent agent.  He only has one client and  one loyal colleague who is  Renee Zellweger.   They end up kind of becoming a couple and    It's really a great movie.   Don't wanna spoil the ending for you.   But anyway  Cuba Gooding junior won best supporting actor for this movie   and it was nominated for five academy awards so    it's a pretty pretty  great movies and there's some pretty classic lines in this one.   So if you haven't seen it you definitely want to check it out and it's Jerry Maguire starring Tom Cruise.	3.786
What up guys, this is Cade and I'm doing a review of  the Blade Trinity. This is the third  installment in the Blade series, the movie is the final one, and this is the special unrated version.   With the unrated version what you get is pretty much as it says on the back ten more minutes of action. So you got an extra fight scene right there, it's really long and probably just a couple of slow motion stuff going on so not exactly the best extra. But yeah, also the movie itself isn't very good. It's pretty much, you know,  Wesley Snipes playing the vampire hunter Blade and it's from the Ghost Rider comic books. And he hunts for vampires and instead in this one he's joined by these people, there's more people in the team but these are the main ones that we're focused upon and they just go around killing vampires.   This one didn't have sort of the dark feeling that the first two  Blade films have, it's more just like action oriented. I felt like I was watching Triple X or something like that so it's not exactly very high on my list of action films. So overall I give  Blade Trinity a two because it's a little entertaining, but man, overall it's definitely not as good as the first two by any means. So check it out only if you're a diehard fan.	3.873
Hey guys, this is Tay here and I'm going to review the very unexciting movie Stigmata.   This  you can call it pretty much an exorcism movie. You've got  Patricia Arquette I believe, yes, and she   plays this woman right here who gets a little possessed in the movie. She's a hairdresser then she, you know,   like I said gets possessed and you got all these crazy satanic shenanigans going on.  The plot if you ask me is kind of hollow, there's not that much going on. You've got like the typical priest guy that's trying to help her out and so forth and he gets caught up in all this stuff, maybe even falls in love with her or something like that. It's this thing, you know I don't really want to go beyond that in  describing this plot of the stigmata it's just like when you get like living wounds of like the same stuff that Christ had. So you get like hanging from the arm and the feet and so forth and that she gets to start out with, and that's what begins the possession.    This right here has got some special features including  an alternate ending which is pretty interesting, we were watching that. Audio commentary from the director and deleted scenes and also a music video by Natalie Imbruglia. So,   see now I didn't like this movie that much, I gave it two out of five stars, so if you like this movie it's a pretty good DVD to get because you got a lot of special features. Check it out.	4.041
I'd like to tell you about the movie Blade, starring Wesley Snipes. It is    based off a Marvel comic in which a half vampire, Blade, combats the forces of evil.  This DVD is the widescreen version.    It has a couple features on it, particularly the story line development, the technology development.   Actually as far as comic book movies go I find this is a pretty good one. Not many ones are  better than this besides the X-Men one.    It's produced by New Line Cinemas. It's rated R. It's very violent. A lot of swearing, gruesome,  gore, dismemberment, stuff like that.   DVD is a one of these terrible cardboard cases.   I don't like that. And then the, like the chapter names right here give away a lot of the story. It's a comic book so no big twists.   It's an older DVD so it has stuff like the   complete theatrical trailer.  But  oh look, Kris Kristofferson is in it as Whistler, who's a very cool kind of   grizzly old man mentor.  It's a good movie, maybe three out of five. One of the better comic book movies. You can get this cheap    I'd  consider it. You can probably get this in a trilogy set with the other ones but the other ones are terrible compared to this.  So  go for it.	4.509
Idiocracy  {laughs}  This movie is gonna be probably one of the most retarded movies that I've seen this year. Yeah, I guess I use that term lightly, okay retarded,  but that's the whole point of Idiocracy.  But  It's  PG, I'm sorry it's actually rated R and It's about   this guy   and he's in the military and they chose to put him in a program where they're gonna freeze him and they're gonna unfreeze him within a year. And so, they can't find another female, to do this experiment with so they pick   basically a hooker to do it and well anyways. They freeze him and they're supposed to be waking up in a year, but the program gets stopped because of evil actions and they get forgotten and they wake up hundreds of years later and basically through   the gene pool  all the smart people have basically stopped   of conceiving so the   not so smart people just mass produced and  in hundreds of years people are basically just stupid and anyways.  So  stupid funny movie. That's that's  how I would describe it. But, I would have to say, you would probably enjoy it.  I I  thought it was funny, but that's the whole point of being stupid. But, you'd have to watch it to understand what I'm saying.   So, Idiocracy, rated R. Definitely  definitely pick it up.	5.0
Alright,   this is the  movie   Dances with Wolves and if I were asked to put a top ten list of movies, this would definitely be in that list. Absolutely fantastic movie made by Kevin Costner,   it won seven academy awards back in nineteen ninety-one   and if you haven't seen this movie,  then where have you been   because this movie is fantastic. All about captain John Dunbar and his growing up in the frontier and encountering   the native American xxx tribe and it's just a fantastic so  really beautifully filmed.  The music is fantastic, the acting is great , one thing I should mentioned is   almost four hours long, it's three hours   and what fifty-six minutes long.    It's probably up  in nineteen ninety-one when this came out. Never had a show ever been released this long and I don't think there has been a show since then. Lord of the Rings wasn't maybe more than maybe three and a half hours.   Very long movie but,    the time flies by, absolutely fantastic. Now it is rated PG thirteen.    There's some tense scenes in it, some hunting scenes.    The sexual amount in it is some xxx  but nothing overt  that I can recall.  So, the PG thirteen rating I think is primary there's some a little bit profanity in it and there's like I said some tense scenes.  But absolutely fantastic show, you gotta watch this if you haven't seen it. Rent it, buy it,  if you have seen it, it's back up here since it's been out so you might want to get it again and pull it out and watch it again.	6.055
I'm here to talk about this movie  Lost in Translation. It stars Bill Murray  and  it runs for an hour and forty-two minutes and it's rated R.  This has  been out for a little while and   I didn't really like this movie. It was really slow, it was boring,  the story line didn't make any sense at all. It's about some  TV personality, I guess that's what he was, that  went to Japan for to to  do some promotions and  things he did there, the girl he met and all this kind of thing but  I just really didn't enjoy this and I I  just didn't understand   what the story was about and this {sigh}.      I don't I don't  know, you might like this, you might not, but I just didn't really think, you know, I don't think it was up to Bill Murray's standards but   try it, you might think differently.   Thank you.	3.873
Hi this is a movie that stars Kurt Russell and it's called Dark Blue,   and       Kurt Russell kind of played, he plays a L.A. police    guy and  he's a mean guy.   And  he has a new    rookie that goes with him   and  he sort of teaches him the ropes. But in this movie,    Kurt Russell he plays a kind of a   bad character the cop is kind of mean.   And    but he's kind of showing the other guy the ropes, so.   I I  didn't care for the movie because of the,   I didn't like the storyline,   and    at the end I think  you know it  at, the Rodney King    riot breaks out in the movie.   And so there's a twist kind of a twist  at the end but I didn't care for it, I didn't like Kurt Russell in this role,   and I didn't like the movie story and    so I, I  can't recommend this movie.   So I wouldn't buy it but if you want to buy it you can go to amazon dot com and  this is a movie called Dark Blue.	3.559
This is a box set of the original three Star   Wars movies.   A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi.   They are referenced countlessly   in you know, modern culture, modern cinema. You see references you know   Luke I am your father but with somebody else's name. And   they are almost an American icon.   These are the movies that   you know, were in the   late seventies or early eighties before the yuppies existed before George Lucas   had the money to   and the technology to   remove everything   but the actors.   I I  mean in the original Star Wars, people actually acted it.   It's it's  a good set of movies because the story it tells is quite good,    it's got good acting it's it's  one of those   things that are original, that are icons of America and American cinema,   like The Godfather or.   It you can name these movies that are historically you know   referenced and you know everpresent in our society and Star Wars is one of them and   this does it justice.    I think it deserves five out of five stars, I would buy it again if I didn't already have it.	5.802
Hi.  Today's product that I'm going to review is the DVD Bewitched starring   Nicole   Kidman and Will Ferrell.   I didn't care for this movie {laugh}.  I give it probably a two, a rating of two.  And the reason I didn't like it is because   Will Ferrell plays an actor who is going to be doing a new and improved version of Bewitched and then  Nicole Kidman plays a real life witch who comes down to earth to live and then ended up being cast in the role of Samantha on Bewitched.  It's just a really corny movie.  I hate the way that they did that. Pretending that , you know, there were two people and then  they were gonna start playing the actors Samantha and Darren so it's really not about Bewitched.   It's more about this girl who's a witch who plays Samantha.  But as I said I don't really care for it. I mean it's about two hours long.   If you're interested in watching this or even owning it {laugh} you can find it at  any Best Buy, local Walmart, or even on Amazon dot com for under twenty dollars.	4.082
Hi.  today the product that I'm going to review is a DVD. This is Cold Mountain   starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renee Zellweger. This was the winner of   the academy award  best supporting actress, Renee Zellweger.  I hated this movie. {laughter}   I give it probably two stars just because of the actors that are in it, I like them. {laughter}  But if they didn't have those actors I would give it a one.   The story is about  the civil war and how this town, I believe it's called,  it's Cold Mountain  in North Carolina.   And  the men of Cold Mountain decide to go and join the the  war.    the story is mainly about Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweger as they try to survive through the war and wait for their loved ones to come back.  It's   xxx a stupid film. I hate it. Nicole Kidman kind of goes cuckoo during the movie.    {laughter} there's battle scenes and it's  it's  not a movie that I like. But   if you're interested in watching this at all you can find at any Best Buy, Walmart,  even online at Amazon dot com for under twenty dollars.	3.786
Alright.   Pretty, pretty good. Season four Curb Your Enthusiasm. The acclaimed series. Larry David returns for a fourth season. He had five in total, so far. Hopefully he comes back for six. That's my fingers being crossed.  Ten episodes this whole, actually eleven because the tenth episode is pretty much two episodes of it together and it's like an hour.  This whole season is about him  {clears throat}  joining the  cast of  The Producers,  featuring Mel Brooks. He's  in the,   he's in a couple episodes. Ben Stiller, and Ben Stiller's boy are in some episodes. David Schwimmer and some guy playing David Schwimmer's dad is in this too.    After four seasons, actually I have all five seasons, they're phenomenal. It's good stuff. As you see, it keeps to the same packaging which is amazing   you know.   Let me open this again cause this is,   this always amazes me. I like to just sit around, when I can get it to okay, maybe this one doesn't work, but that's not the point. The point is this this   season is as good as all five seasons. it gets a five out of five stars. Larry David's a   curmudgeon and a genius. There you go.	5.745
Alright, this is    not a bad pickup for a bargain movie. It's called The Wrong Guy, starring  David Foley of   Kids in the Hall fame, that Canadian sketch show and Jennifer Tilly who was in, I believe, Bride of Chucky and a bunch of other films but that's the only one that comes to mind cause  they're not exactly the greatest actors and actresses in the world. David Foley was also the voice in the  Pixar film A Bug's Life which  is one of my favorite films, but unfortunately some people don't view it as the best, one of the best  better Pixar films, but {snort} what do they know? Anyways this is   it's a comedy.   I think it's a direct to DVD comedy.  It has some funny jokes in it that are alright. I give it two out five stars. If you see it on like   TV or something like that I'd say watch it.  David Foley is pretty funny, the rest of the cast kind of .    Otherwise two out of five stars as I said before and  he's accused of a murder, well he thinks he's accused of a murder that he didn't commit and it's basically him as a fugitive running away from people that aren't trying to chase him, although he does find the real killer. Two out five stars. {noise}	4.69
Adam Sandler has a lot of movies out.  He started on Saturday Night Live and then broke into the   movie industry. Airheads is one of his earlier movies.  Also it's got Brendan Fraser and Steve Buscemi.  The three play a   metal band, a trio that wants desperately to get heard on the radio and more than anything to have a record deal.   They are all pretty insane and  they break into a record station with squirt guns filled with hot sauce. {clearing throat} Of course the squirt guns it explains early in the movie  do not have the orange cap to indicate that they are toys as opposed to real weaponry.    The whole movie centers around the three trying to get a record deal and getting closer to each other, yeah yeah, all that good stuff. It's a comedy, it's not supposed to be a feel good movie of the year. Hilariously funny, pretty offensive and vulgar at times, but it's definitely worth seeing.  Performances in it are amazing. Adam Sandler plays an idiot which I'm not sure at the time he made the movie was too far a stretch of the imagination. However, it's still a good acting job. I would say definitely check this movie out if you're a metal head.	6.403
Keanu Reeves has risen to be one of the  most popular    action stars of pretty much in the last, probably a decade.    He however did get started making  oh,   rather bad films.   Point Break is one of his worst.   {hmm}, Point Break he plays this, a young FBI agent that    pretty much goes on    or starts with a company and has a partner, Gary Busey, who is a little bit more    experienced. He gives undercover and becomes a surfer and someone who's generally addicted to extreme sports.   He meets up with    Patrick Swayze, which    the is known as the world's most shirtless man.      They  work together   yeah, to uncover, Busey and Keanu Reeves work together to uncover    a string of bank robberies that are portrayed    that are done by the  surfer gang that Keanu Reeves joins.    There's also skydiving,    bad acting, and in general just mayhem.   The movie is meant to be taken seriously, but it's good for a laugh, nothing else.	5.972
Curtis here with the new  the new Hannibal movie, Hannibal Rising.   Now this is a blockbuster exclusive I guess.   Apparently a straight to DVD rental.    So {cough}   you can find it at any Blockbuster.    I was expecting something a little more gory, maybe a little more horror-ish.   But it was really really like  timid and    pretty, pretty    pretty low,   I don't know low budget but not really I don't know. Hannibal    Hannibal Lecter wasn't really, he was played as a character that was like a teenager and he,   he  was kind of like progressing into his cannibalistic stage of the other movies.    I wouldn't really recommended it if, recommend it  if you wanna   like watch a Hannibal movie I'd recommend just going to see like Silence of the Lambs or    Hannibal, the other Hannibal movies.   Which are okay, they're not, they're not  that great either.   But     I don't know I'd recommend it if you want.    If you wanna see a movie that takes before Hannibal I recommend it but if you   like the Hannibal movies and you don't wanna ruin it,   don't see this movie   cuz it will probably ruin it and    you probably won't like Hannibal anymore   cuz he's   I don't know.   Really, really weakling in this movie,   okay, alright, that's my review. Thanks.	4.082
Hi. This movie  review is about   the two-thousand seven movie called Allegro.    It's basically kind of confusing movie  and if I had to give it a grade, it would probably be like  a scale on one to ten it would probably be a five or a six.    The piano playing in the film music were pretty much exciting    and excellent.   This story is really complicated to follow.      It was just hard to go along with the whole movie because    because of the fantasy portion   it was it was  related to the zone   and  basically some people like me cannot follow it, and   it was just kind of boring and confusing.   I don't know it was basically not a movie from mainstream  and  basically it was just kind of a really confusing and boring movie like I said and it's not worth paying your money for   in   my   opinion if it's even out in your theaters. It's really not a great movie. Go see    that's why I give it a five or a four.	2.646
I'm here to review this dvd.   And it's called Sixteen Candles.   It stars Molly Ringwald,   and  it's been out for, for quite awhile, so ,   you know you may have to look a little harder to find it  if you want to see this.    I was very disappointed in this because  it's rated PG.   Now that has to be a typo,   because there's  a lot of bad language, and there's nudity   in this movie. And    I would be really, really careful in watching your kids,  letting your kids see this because   it's not appropriate.   And it's, that's my recommendation this this  is not appropriate for for  young kids to see.  It  I believe it's even been on tv but I'm sure they had to delete those scenes but if you watch this movie,   those things are in there and    for little kids, this movie is deceptive because it looks like it's, you know, it's for  teenagers or whatever,   but   I I  just was greatly disappointed in this,   but  I don't,   I don't   suggest you watch this at all. I mean if you want to check it out if you're curious after what I said, that's that's  up to you but   I don't understand why it says PG on the back when all that stuff is in there, so.     Try it if you want, and    you know, use your own judgement.	5.066
Hi, my name is Nulan and today I will be reviewing for you the movie Hot Fuzz, which is currently in theaters.  Hot Fuzz is a movie which is  which stars  Simon Pegg in  kind of a lead role you could say.  Simon Pegg is basically a police officer and   he's  a one guy who's  who's kind of tops at everything. So, I mean he goes through the best  at academy and the police and  he he  has the top slot, top grades in his  police training and all that stuff. So he's a really good officer, a really sharp officer, and    basically the movie starts with showing him as the ultimate guy and  he's reporting to his chief and the chief  transfers transfers  him to  an old village because   basically   basically the movie starts off with this guy in London but his chief transfers him to  a village in, a remote village named Sandford. So   that's how the movie starts and  basically the transfer is because  all the other police officers in  London are  beginning to look really bad because this guy, because he's so good. So anyway he's transferred to Sandford and   he ends up into a case of, he ends up into a murder mystery kind of a case. But the police over there do not consider it to be murder. They all think that it's an accident always, so that pisses him off and  he goes into   kind of a big mystery and stuff. So aside that basically a story outline of the whole thing, but that's not what I want to convey here. What I basically want to convey here is that it's a very funny movie. I mean it's , it's one of its own types, I mean a very unique, I haven't seen anything like this before because   it's it's  kind of weird the kind of action they put in, but  I mean it, I mean the action is funny too so everything in the movie is funny and  the whole humor in the  movie is depicted very well, so it's an excellent, very well directed, very well made movie and  highly recommend it. I I  just love the movie so I rate it five out of five and I recommend that you should watch it in theaters so that's all. Well I'm Nulan xxx, today I was reviewing for you the in theaters movie Hot Fuzz.	4.69
Hi my name is xxx and today I will xxx the movie for you Kickin' It Old School which is going to be playing in theaters.  Kickin' It Old School is  movie about a kid who is very interested in break dancing and    given in his childhood days he gets into an accident   and   while break dancing itself   and he goes into a coma for twenty years.    He wakes up twenty years later and   he finds out that he's still kid but with that and also he xxx that dream of making it big in breaking dance in the break dance industry so   he regroups his friends and they enter a competition   and  the movie goes on from there there is also this girl who is   who is so interested in him     same thing I mean    the rivals from his childhood is again the same rival and    the whole movie is about how he win the xxx and how he wins the whole competition so   the   I mean   the plot plot  sounds just okay but the movie is   utterly disappointing I mean I did not really enjoy the movie a lot   basically because of  the fact that you know xxx   that the guy as a kid and  I mean none of the guys did an exceptional jobs so   ended up very disappointed with the movie   I do not recommend you watch the trailers   I don't even recommend you watch it because    I actually just rated   two out of five so   that's all. Thank you.	4.509
Hey ExpoTV, I'm Dea, and I generally love sort of these bad teen comedy sort of movies.    But like I said, generally which implies that I don't always love them.  One that I didn't love was Drive Me Crazy    this is a movie with Melissa Joan Hart, where   her character, she's trying to    she's trying to like, get the   popular basketball guy or whatever to ask her out.   And so   and her best friend next door neighbor guy,   is trying to win back his exgirlfriend.   So they turn to each other.   You know, to sort of fake a relationship to make those two jealous,   Melissa Joan Hart gives him a makeover,   and it's all, it all  feels very like,   it's not,   it's not,  it doesn't have the sort of undercurrent of satire that a lot of high school comedies have,   that sort of make them funny. It seems like it's missing something, and it's just overall not really great, and I wouldn't really suggest it to yeah.	6.055
Hey ExpoTV I'm Dea   and something that I've mentioned so many times in so many different videos is that I love superhero movies.   And I just like the cheese factor, the cheesier the better.   That's how much I love them I'm like a big fan.    And I've also mentioned that I do very few negative reviews,   alas this is one of those   and what's even worse is that it is about a superhero movie.   This right here is Hulk.  Okay, here's something that I have to tell you.  I will usually stick it out no matter what like, if I'm reading a book that I don't care for, I'll finish reading it anyway  just to get to the end and you know have an actual educated view of it. If I'm watching a movie  I'll stick it out until the end because you know, I want to see what happens maybe it redeems itself. This movie was so bad that I couldn't you know, I tried watching it to the end and I was like  this is awful on a level that I have previously not experienced in my existence. I mean like,  like Shazam with Shaquille O'Neal awful.  So as a person who like, you know I know a lot of people who are like, I don't, I don't  dig the superhero movies, they're too corny for me. I feel like as a person who loves the corn factor, if I didn't like it there's really something wrong.	7.0
Charlotte's Web.   This is a cute little movie.  It is PG for all audiences. It's based on the book Charlotte's Web.  Of course it's got little special effects in it because all your little barnyard critters are talking to one another.  But it's just like the book. Wilbur the pig is  befriended by Charlotte the spider and  she promised him that she's gonna do whatever it takes to prevent him from being Christmas dinner. She wants him to see  his first snowball and  it's just  cute little movie.   There is a character in there that I think is a hoot. I'm not sure what his name is but he is the rat and he is funny and he's he's  also a big help when it comes to helping Charlotte choose the words that are needed to draw attention to Wilbur. So with Charlotte writing the words in the web and the farmer seeing those words and eventually they're able to save Wilbur and he makes it to that first snowfall and he makes it to Christmas.  But , it's a cute little movie, just like the book and    definitely would recommend it for all ages.  So, Charlotte's Web.	2.16
Hi, I'm Marshall Hammer   and I'd like to review   Live from Baghdad   starring Michael Keaton and Helena Bonhma-Carter.   Now this movie I think is timeless   because    it has to do with war and bombings and   we're becoming more and more familiar with that type of action   in our country today.   Now Helena Bonham-Carter   is, I'm a huge fan of hers and she's excellent in this film,   as well as Michael Keaton I   think this is probably   the number one thing that I've seen him in.      Ebert and Roeper gave this two thumbs up and I would give this a five on the rating scale of Expo TV.   So  I really think you should check it out.   It's based on a true story      by CNN or involving CNN in nineteen ninety.   When a news team went over to   Baghdad to get some footage.   And  their lives   got into great danger.   So check it out,   I give it a five,   Live from Baghdad starring Michael Keaton   and Helena Bonham-Carter.	6.403
Hi my name is Nalin and today I will be reviewing for you the movie Can't Hardly Wait.    Can't Hardly Wait is a movie which starts out as a,   in a, in a  high school graduation ceremony kind of a setting and    it starts out as everybody is discussing in the,   in the   ceremony that    Amanda was    dumped by a man named Mike Dexter.   So Amanda is actually the   homecoming queen and    Mike Dexter is the homecoming king.   And    they were like the hot couple   of the high school for four years and    that's where the whole hype about their breakup. So   then it starts out that the guy, there's a guy who likes    the girl Amanda.    Who is the prom queen.   So that guy other prom queen Amanda is played by Jennifer Love Hewitt and    the other guy who likes her a lot is played by Ethan Ambrey.    The movie on the whole is very average, I mean    there were very, very boring parts in the whole movie.   Not very exciting stuff.    Not too much humor,   very predictable and you can actually just figure out what's gonna happen in the end. So   it's a very boring movie I would just rate it one out of five.    A special mention about    Ethan Ambrey's acting in the movie.   It is horrible.    I mean I don't know what other kind of expressions he's given but   he looks at   I mean, many times he just looks like he's having    stomach problems so   his acting is just horrible.   But from that Jennifer Love Hewitt is the main reason I got the DVD to watch and    she's looking cute and  she's looking pretty good, so.   I mean on that front I kind of liked the movie because she's just looking cute but   the whole story I do not recommend that you watch the movie so   that's all.	4.509
Hello, my name is Nulan and  today I will be reviewing for you the movie Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle which is on DVD. So   Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle is the second part of a movie which was initially released as Charlie's Angels. So this movie also,   the  I mean the second part of Charlie's Angels also  had the same   three actresses: Lucy Liu, Drew Barrymore, and Cameron Diaz. So the whole movie's about these three girls who are a part of    who are the basic , you know,  part of    a team which saves the world always so this time around, I mean, and and  it basically like they work for Charlie who operates through a guy named Bosley. And I mean  Bosley meets the Charlie's Angels and Bosley's kind of the interface between  Charlie and the Charlie's Angels. So this time around the interesting part is that there's     a different  mission on hand, it's about  a list of people, a list of  hotshot people, and  that list is in danger and that's not good for the country so ,   you know, the angels go out in search of those so   there's a twist to the whole story and I I  don't think I should mention it on the   review because that would spoil the whole movie   so I think you should go ahead and watch the movie and find out the whole twist of the movie.    The other interesting thing about the movie is that  as  was in the previous   Charlie's Angels movie the whole moves are always  defying   physics laws and    that's not very nice thing I I  like. I mean I I  don't like it personally, so  but if you're one of those who likes excessive use of invisible ropes  you want to watch this movie. I did not like that one aspect of this movie so apart from that the acting is mediocre, nothing special.  The whole  story outline is, again, mediocre. Nothing too special in any of these. I think  a bit of  comedy is     good in the form of  Lucy Liu's dad.  Dad's  appearance a very small stint and  that's kind of funny part of the movie but that's about it. So I rate this movie  around between two or three out of five. And  unless you really, really like invisible ropes I do not recommend that you watch it. So that's all. I'm Nulan xxx. I was reviewing for you Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle. Thank you.	3.109
So remember my review of Ocean's Twelve and how terrible it was? Well now I'm going to review Ocean's Eleven, which was actually very very good.  This movie stars   George Clooney, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, George Pitt, Julia Roberts and a bunch of other guys too.  it is very good. It's about these guys who have to break into a casino to rob it in Las Vegas. And so  even for someone like me who's never actually been to Las Vegas this is very, very interesting. Because it kind of, I mean even though it's probably not all true, gives a fun look into what they've envisioned the back rooms and secret passageways of the casinos to be like. So it's very fun. It allows you to really get into it as the viewer,  which not all movies are like nowadays. A lot of them have a sort of disconnect.  But it seems like a very  easy movie to understand. And it's just a lot of fun. You find yourself really  rooting for the main characters and hoping they'll get it, even though they are criminals you find yourself very much along with the ride, along with them for the ride.    Now the DVD itself is full of  just a ton of behind the scenes documentaries,  extended scenes, extra deleted scenes,  interviews with directors, casts, everything. It's just really packed full of stuff. So if you're looking for a good DVD to spend a Saturday afternoon with, Ocean's Eleven, check it out.	6.055
Hi this is a review of the DVD movie Stomp the Yard widescreen.    It came out just a couple weeks ago   to rent   on DVD and     this movie   is about    a group of people    that basically I don't know they, it's not really breakdancing it's it's  kind of different,  the movie covers a lot of stepping and  I don't know. This movie was okay.    But to me like it seemed like the focus was just way too much on the dancing  hence the title Stomp the Yard and the previews obviously had a lot of dancing so  I don't know what I was expecting but I thought it would be something a little bit different but     For me I guess I just really wasn't educated on the culture enough to really know what was going on there was a lot of stuff that was confusing or I didn't even think was very cool   in this movie and didn't make sense.    I don't know the dancing is really weird and it's it's  intense.    But there's just not enough not enough  plot tied in with it and it's too like, just predictable and   you know, it's exactly what you'd expect in the plot and I think they should've focused more on  the dialogue and the plot in this movie than the dancing. So  this movie review is to me, you know, because I wasn't really into the whole dancing which was the focus of it I didn't really like it but if you're into like stepping and like,    just kind of like the dance art form   then you'd probably appreciate this movie more as there's a lot of street styles and other stuff in it.    The movie is PG-thirteen and   it is    you know, it's got high definition audio and it's it's  a hundred and fourteen minutes, it's just short of two hours.    It does a pretty decent job of keeping your attention for the time spent but and like I said you know just other than the dancing it's just an okay movie the acting's okay, there's not really anything that surprised me, it's just    you know, a guy meets a girl type thing after he gets out of some trouble and people don't want him to be with that girl and she already has a boyfriend and then. Stuff like that I won't ruin the ending or anything but   it's okay so I would just give it two or three stars   out of five.	3.109
The movie I'm reviewing is The Ex, and it's in movie theaters now and it stars  Zach Braff and Amanda Peet. And basically it's just  the two of them are husband and wife and the story's just about  him losing his job and they go to live with her parents and then he works for her dad. And    The one guy that he works with was involved with Amanda Peet  before, and so he's the ex.   But it's supposed to be a comedy and it really wasn't all that funny.    I had somebody when I watched the movie  near us who was just laughing obnoxiously at everything so that also kind of made it a little weird. But  it just like I said it wasn't really too funny and the story line wasn't really all that great either. so  if you're looking to just go see any kind of movie,  you could go see it but it's not one I would really recommend. And I probably wouldn't recommend  renting it either when it comes out on DVD so. It's The Ex and I would probably give it about a five out of ten.	3.559
If you ever wanna make an action movie with  five dollars for the plot and for    the props and everything.   This is the movie.   Phone Booth.    Has good names in it, I mean there's Colin Farrell, There's Forest Whitaker and Kiefer Sutherland  good old Jack Bauer's son.   But,   the whole story takes place inside of a phone booth.   You can change the angles all you want but,   come on.   This is really boring.    Action  movies usually have action in them.   So it makes no sense to have it stand in the same spot for   too long    how long is it, two hours.   I think it's nearly two hours could be wrong on that.    Basically it was just terrible.    I I  would never watch this again.   There's very few movies I would say I'd never watch again and this is one of them. It's up there with Mars Attacks for its annoying factor and the fact that it never moves.   But I mean there's, there's  got some twists in it that's every action movie has that.    Well any good one. But as far as the action goes it just really wasn't that good, it was more of a drama so   I don't like that.	5.802
Elf is awesome.  I think this is one of my favorite   Christmas movies, mainly because Will Ferrell's in it and he's a cool, funny man and I really respect his work.  This here is the Infinite Film version  it has a bunch of special features in there. And   {laugh} what's what's  there to say about Elf? I mean, look at the front. He's an elf. He's a grown man.  The story basically starts off with a grown boy, well not grown, I guess you'd say human boy being dropped off at the north pole and trying to fit in with the elves and then eventually  the movie starts with him having to go find his real parents.  And then that's when it becomes hilarious because  he's an elf and he's in New York City I believe, is the city he goes to. {laugh} And you don't see elves in New York City walking around all the time. And    yeah, I   this is by far one of the most, like, like most  funny movies out there,  Christmas time or not, and Will Ferrell does an amazing job. Even if he's carrying the movie  there's also other stars like Zooey Deschanel and     Bob Newhart's his papa, and he he  does a good job, and his job is James Caan and  all kind of big names, kind of known,  but yeah basically you should watch this movie, I give it a five out of five.	5.0
Here we have Stealth.   This movie was pretty predictable,   and, not that entertaining.    I mean, it has all the big names in it that you've heard before.     Josh Lucas, Jessica Beil, and Jamie Foxx.   However, I don't know, it just lacked a lot of  good, in the movie.    I  without a better word good. , I don't know if it was the screenplay or what,   but this movie just wasn't very memorable and not very captivating.     The whole premise of this movie is that , the government has made an AI plane,   which that means  artificial intelligence. That ,  plane is very smart, and learns,   and it put it together with this three man team, the three characters on the front   to go on missions and then as the premise of the movie begins,  it goes haywire.    So, from that point, I'll let you decide, but that's just on the back, the back  of the thing.    I'm not ruining anything for you.    I don't think it's possible.    The movie ruins it for itself.    So, I'd probably give it a, one out of five.  Not good at all.	4.83
Fighting Temptations.  This was such a cute movie.   Thoroughly enjoyed it.    my husband has actually seen it before me on cable and he said oh you gotta watch this movie and so we watched it and then I bought him this    DVD for Christmas because I knew how much he enjoyed it, I actually looked around to be able to find it. It was hard to find  and Cuba Gooding, Jr.   he's just so funny  so much fun to watch in movies and he actually does some really good dancing in his movie and Beyonce Knowles is in it as the lead actress and   they are just so  engaging to watch  beautiful people and I love the premise of the movie where he is kinda a no gooder and     he gets this inheritance  he's promised this inheritance and basically what he kinda does to think or to get his inheritance and just kinda how it's sometimes   the good and bad in people and how we're torn to do what's right. And so it's a really good movie, great music and dancing and a great message.	5.745
This is The Twelve Kingdoms Collection Two and this was really sad. It's a premium box edition where you got all the, all the  discs and their  disc covers but  this has been collected into a nice little package here {noise}  in in  the economy collection. And you can see how the discs are arranged. They are the original  ones that they put out on DVD so  you're getting all the features and everything that was originally there on the individual releases. And this continues the story of  Youko who was a young girl that  found herself  into an alternate world and   she ends up    getting caught into this fantastic destiny in this fantasy land and  some people have  compared this to Fushigi Yugi except they said this is the good version of Fushigi Yugi cause it doesn't have a character that's quite as annoying as  Miss Miaka was in, in  that particular show. But this is beautifully animated. If you did enjoy Fushigi Yugi you are most likely going to love this cause there's a lot of political intrigue, there's all kinds of betrayals going on, there's romance. I mean this has absolutely everything that you would want into an anime. Action scenes, it's it's  everything wrapped up in one. And this is the   the final part that's been animated   plus five volumes further and this  second collection. And  this pretty much finishes up everything that's been animated from the Twelve Kingdoms so far. It was a series of books in Japan and they did not animate the entire thing but it does have a  decent conclusion. So I wouldn't worry too much about that, it's definitely worth the ride and you do get to see enough of the story to make it worthwhile. So five out of five stars for this  collection of the Twelve Kingdoms, collection number two. And it retails for about thirty-nine ninety-nine which is a steal for five DVDs.   And there you have it.	5.26
I will be reviewing the  special edition of Groundhog Day starring  Andie MacDowell and Bill Murray.   This is   probably one of my favorite movies and definitely my favorite comedy, you know, that I own.   Groundhog Day, for those of you who don't know, Bill Murray plays a very jaded you know, a very cynical  weatherman   who is sent to, you know,   his most  hated assignment, which is you know, covering xxx, the groundhog day to see whether he sees his shadow or not.  And he goes today, it's a horrible day and there's a snowstorm so he can't leave the town so you know, he stays in the same place he stayed and when he gets up the next morning,  it's groundhog day again and you know the whole day just completely repeats itself, you know, he's kinda think he's going nuts and you know it just keeps happening over and over again even if he,   you know, happens to die during the day, he literally just wakes back up and you know that same morning,  over and over again.   You know throughout he, you know the love interest, Andie MacDowell, falls in love  continually tries,   you know, to get into the bed, you know, although he only has an actual day to do it because he keeps starting over.   I mean honestly, it's just a really, really well made movie, it's definitely  Bill Murray, you know, at one of his best and most comical roles. His his  performance is absolutely hilarious, you know,   the different emotions. It kinda follows, you know, the  you know five stages of death, you know, where you have to denial   and you know, anger, and you know finally at the end acceptance.  This is an all around great movie and you know, it does have a bit of , you know, philosophical vibe to it, you know, as far as, you know, should approach life but it doesn't really take itself too, too  seriously.   The disk itself isn't bad,   it's got an audio commentary by the director,   you know, a documentary called the wait of time which is pretty cool, you know, some theatrical trailers   and  photographies, and that's really about it, there's not a whole, whole lot here but really,   this is the only version of the movie that I have ever seen and I just wanted the movie really,  really badly, you know, the extras are kind of  icing on a cake.    Definitely get this movie if you don't have it.	6.055
I'll be reviewing Ang Lee's Hulk. This is the two disc special edition.  I didn't really think it was possible for them to make a movie about the Hulk that was actually boring, but somehow they managed to do it.  This is one of the movies where I really found myself just constantly looking at the  at the clock to see how much longer it had. You know, and I'm a pretty I'm pretty  big fan of, you know, slow paced movies. I don't need a whole, whole lot of action. But this one just was badly paced.  You know, slow,  it was the characters weren't  developed enough, you know, to hold me, you know, during  the slower-paced parts of the movie and that kind of thing.  It was just kind of a poorly made movie in general. You know, Ang Lee just really tried to put too much style and not enough substance into it.    You know, the Incredible Hulk is basically about a scientist, Bruce Banner, who is messing with  gamma radiation. And he turns himself into  basically this gigantic, when he gets angry, he becomes this gigantic green, you know, ridiculously strong  hulk.   And  {cough} basically his level of anger, you know,  correlates directly with, you know, how big he gets and, you know, the rest of the U.S. government and all that has to try and stop him, {mumble}. You know, it's not that complicated of a storyline, honestly.    The DVD itself isn't too bad. It's got some never  some deleted scenes, you know,  some  special effects documentaries. You know, look at taking the Hulk from the comics to the movie.  You know, a motion capture suit documentary. So, you know, and some stills from the comics, that kind of thing. Not a whole, whole lot in here. You know, honestly, I think it's a pretty forgettable movie and it's not one you really need to see.	6.403
I'll be reviewing  Queen of the Damned.   This movie is based of  Anne Rice's   vampire chronicles.    It's basically about   Aliyah who plays the queen of the vampires who is, you know basically   brought back into modern world after you know being in hibernation basically by  Lestat   who is Anne Rice's kind of antihero who is now become   a  rock goth you know, rock star who basically you know,   brings her back. Area to consciousness through you know his attraction to him.   And basically you know she wants to you know take over the world and all that other kinda stuff for vampires.    It's a pretty forgettable movie honestly you know it's got a really heavy grunge soundtrack the movie kinda fits in its  shot   you know very slickly. You know trying to be just very uber cool to the point where it's almost just kind of goofy.   It's kind of overdoes it in a lot a lot  of ways.   You know Aliyah is you know a decent performer, Stuart Townsend is kind of pretty  you know Brad Pitt did a lot better job playing Lestat.   In  interview with the vampire.    Than she does here,   I mean than  Stuart Townsend does here.   But the DVD itself you know if you're a fan of the movie is  you know pretty complete. It's got audio commentaries, directors and special you know    documentaries on special effects.   It's got music videos for some of the songs. {cough} You know that are used and saw in the movie.   And like I said it's    it's a pretty decent collection you know for this movie if you're a fan of Anne Rice you know and her particular interpretation of vampires which   personally I think just kind of ruined the whole mythos you know vampires in general making them too I guess,   gothic and you know upper class and emo and that kind of thing. I thought it kinda ruined you know the whole horror aspect of vampires but   that's that's  a personal opinion you know if you're a fan of Anne Rice and you're a fan of the whole goth version of vampires then you know then you'll you'll  probably like this movie.	4.082
This time I've got a major motion picture DVD review, this is the cinematic excellence known as Donny Darko the director's cut.  This movie is amazing, it it's  for a lot of people it's very confusing because they don't quite understand temporal anomalies which the movie explains to some general degree but, perhaps it's just my love of   temporal anomalies and physical or physics impossibilities and what not that I love it.  The acting in this is amazing this of course stars Jake Gyllenthal so  Gyllethaal jall   whatever you know what I mean    and as well as  other little  other    lesser roles  as  Drew Barrymore and even  Jake Gyllenhaal's sister Maggie Gyllenhaal  this is just an  amazing movie mainly because    it's it's  science fiction but it's drama at the same time this'll make you feel a lot of emotions that you don't quite understand all at once,   so  it's definitely one to watch  preferably with friends  but but  it's definitely something to watch not necessarily a party movie like hey bring out the beer, put on a movie, no it's not that type of movie   you you  will just be almost twitching afterwards just because of the  the things that it can   if you understand or things that you understand or try to understand the thing's that it presents so  it's it's  a very  an just an amazing movie,  time travel, science fiction,    life and death, parallel universes all of this is covered in this movie but without having like an over like oh Stargate or something type of   science science fiction feel to it or something, so definitely check this out you will not be sorry      pretty much everyone who has seen this movie has loved it so it's a it's a  little weird but especially  the Director's cut it adds a lot of cool scenes to it as well as some director's commentary if you're into that    so definitely check it out, it is not one to miss.	6.403
I'll be reviewing the  DVD version of Reign of Fire, starring Matthew McConaughey and Christian Bale, with Christian Bale giving probably the worst performance of his career as far as I'm concerned.  I don't rate this movie  very highly. I think it's pretty hokey and pretty much a pretty forgettable throwaway  action movie.   If you don't know what it's about   it's kind of the excavation of a new tunnel in  in England uncovers an egg of a dragon which hatches and manages to breed by itself creating a world of, of dragons and basically annihilates most of  human society as they burn scorch the earth and you know and feed on the ash kind of thing. But there's you know, a rag tag  groups of survivors you know, trying to fight the  the dragons and survive and    Christian Bale plays one of the survivors. Matthew McConaughey plays a American group of survivors kind of show up and the two of em  basically have kind of a dominance leadership fight, while trying to fight the dragons. You know this movie is basically  designed simply around having, trying to have cool action sequences between modern jet fighters and    and ancient you know medieval era dragons   and unfortunately a lot of the plot and character gets lost, you know ii that emphasis. It's just overall not a great movie. You know it's really good if you're just looking for something different or you're a huge fan of dragons, but otherwise it's honestly pretty forget  forgettable.   The special feature includes, what you'd usually see in you know, a mid level type DVD like this, you know. It has a documentary on the special effects,  you know the trailers.   Doesn't actually have a commentary track but it has what it calls a conversation with the director, which is basically you know, a pretty short short interview that doesn't really, you know, say that much about   the direction because honestly there  there wasn't really much that focus on the direction in the first place you know. It's about pretty pretty average, like in general.    But you know, like I said, if you like action movies you know, pretty B rated action movies or if you're a big fan of dragons, maybe it's worth seeing. Otherwise it's it's  pretty forgettable. Just a rental.	5.0
Hi, this is a review of the movie three hundred.   For those who don't know it's    loosely based on a historical Greek battle and the movie  is takes place about   three hundred years B.C. but it also has a lot of mythology mixed in so it's not historically accurate at all and the violence is extremely over exaggerated and it's very, it's highly stylized I guess you could say.    A lot of people are confused and think it's directed by the same person as Sin City.   That's not the case.  It was based on a comic by the same guy who wrote the comic book Sin City. But  the violence is stylized just like the violence in Sin City just not the black and white type style.  About eighty percent of the movie seems to be in slow motion, like someone getting a body part cut off or just    blood flying through the air and the dialogue is cheesy and cliche. But the violence and the scenery more than makes up for it and   if you haven't already seen it, I would go see it now while it's still in theaters so you get the full experience of seeing it on the big screen. Or get it on like HD DVD when it comes out for sure cause it's got some  some of the best special effects and cinematography I've seen in a recent movie. It's action packed, I definitely wouldn't take the kids to see it.    Cause there is some nudity and tons of violence but all in all it's a pretty good film, especially if you're a guy.	5.477
Hi, my name is Mary and today I'll be reviewing a movie that I recently saw in theaters and it's called Are We Done Yet? And  this is part of the series  with Ice Cube. Anyways, Ice Cube plays this guy named Nick Persons who has just married the woman of his dreams, Suzanne, and   he wants to settle down so he  buys a quiet suburban house to escape,   you know, the hustle and bustle of,   you know, the city life. {clears throat}  And   and,   you know, to open up space for his new wife and  kids, Lindsay and Kevin. But   sadly what happens is that  his house actually becomes very, very expensive to fix up and he has to deal with this like really weird, crazy   contractor and  it's just a barrel of laughs.    It's an hour and thirty-two minutes long so it's really not that long, but overall {laugh} it's just a really pointless movie. I just felt like all the jokes were not that funny,  and there were some funny parts but really not, not  really. And   the acting was okay, but   overall the plot was pretty bad. I just felt like we were going nowhere and   basically I just really wanted it to end {laugh} so overall I would not recommend this movie. Alright, thanks.	4.082
Hey,    this is a review of  Are We Done Yet which is a     abysmal movie starring    ice cube. It was    it was a pain to sit through really it was   it was kinda a mystery that it was   was made you know. There was probably a lot better movies that  get passed up but  this  somehow made it.  It   feels like about half a movie should've been cut which would be kinda a short film but    probably would've been easy to sit through.    The trailer was pretty funny but   don't be misled. It was  it was terrible.    Don't waste your time, I  give it a one out of five for not being funny  although ice cube is pretty cool.	5.477
Hey  this is a review   of DOA: Dead or Alive.      Probably never heard of it.      It wasn't really advertised too much    probably with good reason they were probably embarrassed that they made it. It was ,   it's a terrible movie.   It had   very little plot.      The action, the fighting was good I suppose but    everything else   was terrible.    Well I guess    the cast was,   the cast was good I liked the cast.   But    not for their acting abilities, mostly   and it was mostly eye candy but    yeah, it was   pretty bad movie I'd stay away from it.    I wouldn't even   rent it unless you're   very, very bored but there are a lot of   better movies out there and   give it a   two out of five.   So    yeah.   Stay away.	5.066
Hi. I'm here to give you a video review of a terrible movie.   Mission Impossible Two, starring Tom Cruise.  Now   I I've  honestly found the entire Mission Impossible movie series   has been somewhat lacking. The first one had a insanely convoluted plot and was just difficult to follow.   The second one was probably the best out of all three, the third one was just terrible, not even worth mentioning. This one is a hundred and twenty-three minutes long, so it's pretty long, and it follows   Tom Cruise's character as he tries to stop the deadly Chimera virus from attacking the world.  Now one thing I thought was pretty cool about this movie was the technology they used called the facemaker.    It allows  the characters to make an exact copy of someone's face and then sneak in somewhere and then pull it off,   and you never expect it until they actually pull it off. It looks really weird.  But the actual movie has kind of a fun soundtrack, it was real popular at the time, had some of the more popular bands. It was really trying to jazz up the series for the teenage market I think. As you can see from the DVD cover here it's got motorcycles and fire which are two things that are are  fun in the movie,   but the acting is terrible.  And honestly some of the action isn't as great as it could be. So  while this can be a a  slightly fun movie I would probably only give it a two out of five. So check it out if you're bored, but if you're not  don't bother. Go see the original Jurassic Park instead. Oh yeah.	5.0
The Shawshank Redemption is what I'm going to be video reviewing tonight.   And this is an amazing movie, this is one of my favorites of all time.   The story follows a man, Andy Dufresne,   who is  wrongfully imprisoned.   Now the    the story is mostly just about his experiences in life in prison.   He meets up with Red, Morgan Freeman,   and just generally has a bunch of,   I wouldn't necessarily call them adventures, but this    explores his life and times very well.      Now I'm not gonna reveal any of the secrets of the movie.   But   it's just very, very good. It's kind of long, it's about a hundred-and-forty-two minutes long, so don't sit down and watch this unless you got some time   on your hands.   But I think, I know I would be hard-pressed to find anyone who doesn't like it.    My favorite part   was probably   all of his,   Andy Dufresne's interactions with the prison guards.   Because there's,   played so well by the actors.   You can really sense say  a dynamic and a a  difference between prisoner and    prison guard. Even though it is just acting, it's so very good.   So if you're looking for a fantastic movie,   check out The Shawshank Redemption.   I guarantee it. You're gonna like it.	6.403
Hi my name is Kristen and this is my review of   The Right Stuff.    This is the two disc,   two disc special edition.   This movie actually came out back in the early eighties.    nineteen eighty three to be exact.   I guess it's like a real classic but you know,   we'd never heard of it, so. {laughter}   But yeah I mean I guess I've heard of it I'd just never seen it.    It's about the space program and how it developed   and    it talk, you know it begins with Chuck Yeager who is a test pilot,   and he wants to break the sound barrier.   And just kind of goes on and shows the training and what was involved could be with becoming one of the first astronauts.   I have to say I really enjoyed this movie.      It's just, it's a really fun movie. You know it's got like Dennis Quaid in it when he was really young   and   let's see and what else that you might know.    Ed Harris you know people like that and,   it's it's  really, really fun and informative.    It has some fun special features on it.   It has a profile about John Glenn.   And    a few other documentaries about the making of it.   But yeah if you're looking for a great gift and you have a friend that's really into space   I would definitely recommend this movie.   There you go.	6.0
Hey  this is a review of three hundred,   which I think at this point    probably be ninety percent of America has seen.   And with good reason, it is    monumental. It's epic.   It's    it's amazing.    The the  battles,   is, they're perfect.    The CG is perfect it's   pretty amazing   what they can do nowadays. It's it's  inspirational   will change your life.    But yeah it's got a good story.   It's got good characters.   It's got pretty much everything you ever need   including you know gore   with the story.    But it gives you a little   kind of a taste of history.    Yeah very enjoyable   see it buy it.   Five out of five.	5.354
Hey.  This is a review of Live Free or Die Hard,   which is  actually just opened in theaters and is still currently there and I'm sure will do very good this weekend because it is  an amazing movie.  Being a fan of the original Die Hard and sequels  I was glad to see that it stayed true to the Die Hard roots. It  had great action, featured real stunts which was a good change  from current movies.   It had a good story, had a great villain.   Pretty much everything you expect from Die Hard it delivered.   It's an amazing movie, you need to go see it. The only negative that I could think of was there was no Carl Winslow,   Sergeant Al Powell, which was a little disappointing but  I can look past that to see this great movie for what it is.   Don't be bothered by the PG-thirteen. It   besides cussing it has everything else, well I mean it has cussing but just not to the extent that the original Die Hard did, but  it's still a great movie. Five out of five.	6.403
Hi, everyone. Today I'm going to do my Expo review on this DVD movie called Final Fantasy seven.  This is the two-disc special edition. So it has the movie and then it has other scenes, clips, and other games or whatever on the second disc.  It came out a a  year or two after the the  Playstation game that was Final Fantasy seven, which was a great game. This DVD, however, sucks. I really didn't like it. It was all basically, it's basically the game, but you just get to watch all the scenes in a movie form.  And it makes Cloud, the main character, look like a real big, like, sissy or something. He doesn't look very  heroic, like I thought he would have been in the game.   So I didn't really like this DVD, a waste of fifteen dollars. You could probably get it for under five dollars now, since it's so old and so bad.  I definitely don't suggest this to anyone who's played the video game, because it will ruin the game for you.   And it's called Final Fantasy seven. Thanks.	5.745
Hi, today I'd like to review Saved on DVD,  and this is a comedy starring Mandy Moore, Jena Malone, Patrick Fugit and Macauley Culkin.    And it's basically a,   teen comedy, satire, about   people who are overly religious, and,  , well it's got a few funny moments. It's generally pretty predictable and   not that original. But , the actors are all good ,  and it's something that, you know, a young teenager would definitely enjoy.    , The DVD has a few special features like deleted scenes, bloopers,   two audio commentaries and a featurette so,  pretty nice for a one disc edition and ,  if you're just looking for something kind of light and funny to watch this might be a good choice.  It's called Saved on DVD.	2.16
Hi.  Today I'm reviewing the movie Bridge to Terabithia.  In this movie the main, the two main characters are young children.   one is a girl that just moved in, the other is a boy that lives  close to this girl. The girl had never really made very many friends,  and the boy really doesn't have that many friends either.   if you see the previews, the previews shows a lot of animation and a lot of, like   fictional characters that are in the movie.   this is, to me, this movie was a very  big disappointment.   it really didn't have that many fictional characters  or  they actually had every character that was shown,  but they're only there for like, if you took the whole movie, maybe a minute and a half, two minutes.  So, it was more,  you know, it, it  really didn't have the imaginary characters that you think the movie would have throughout the entire movie.   I was disappointed also in in the  how the movie   had a twist and it was a negative twist. And I think the kids need positive twists, not negative twists.  I thought overall the movie stunk.  You know, I mean  it was good, but it wasn't good because of the twists it had and  I'm not going to tell you what the twist was, but you'll see what it is,  and I usually like to have children's movies that have happy, happy movies throughout the entire movie and not to have disappointment in the movie.  So, overall I give this movie thumbs down.	5.196
The product I'm unfortunately reviewing today is Garfield the movie.   Now I didn't buy this movie,   I don't think anybody bought this movie. The stars of the movie, their parents wouldn't buy this movie.    I won this  at the second door prize something.    The the  best thing I can say about this movie is that it comes in a fancy orange DVD case.    They probably should have actually called the movie  Bill Murray needs a paycheck.    He does the voice of Garfield.  I don't know why  someone like Billy Murray would    slum it doing this.  The other stars in the movie are Brecken Meyers and Jennifer Love Hewitt, but they're washed up it's not surprising they're in a movie like Garfield.    The movie pretty much   follows the plot of the  the daily comic. Garfield hates Mondays. Garfield loves lasagna. Garfield kicks Odie.    This movie is not funny, it's not good. CGI was stupid.  I, I  really don't know if just, never see this movie please.    I can't really say much more because I think I'm going to go insane in front of this box any more. One in five.	5.972
Hello, I am Matthew and I'm here to tell you about this DVD movie, Little Black Book.   This is  a romantic comedy.  But I really didn't enjoy it that much I have to say.   It wasn't very romantic.   The jokes weren't really that funny. It just didn't work.   The chemistry  between these two people,    it just doesn't work.   It was slightly choppy at times.   This is definitely a chick flick, I think   many teenage girls would probably enjoy it and you know, I don't really mind   romantic comedies  if they're good  but this one just didn't work.   It drug out.   I couldn't wait for this movie to be over.   The only thing redeeming about this   movie, was about a thirty second cameo by    Gavin Rossdale, which is a rock singer.   That was the only thing I liked about this movie.  This is not a good movie to watch with your girlfriend.   I didn't enjoy it. I think thirteen dollars is too much for this movie and I would not recommend it.	5.0
I'm not quite sure why this is in my video collection.   Probably because I bought it about ten years ago,  or actually I probably got it for Christmas.  But The Fast and the Furious starring Paul Walk, Paul Walk, Paul Walker and Vin Diesil.  This is a terrible movie.   There's really not much to say. It's about people that race cars   I don't understand the whole concept of it.  Okay, let's, let's  spend ten-thousand dollars on a Honda or a Toyota,  something that sounds like you're about to go mow my yard.  Let's put forty to fifty-thousand dollars into this car and then go racing and be like, Oh, what's up man? You've got a ten second car.  No. Why don't you take your money and go buy a viper?   Why don't you go buy something that's actually fast and has a lot of muscle and enough torque to actually, like, bend your little honda civic in half or something?  So overall I don't understand the concept. I think it promotes high schoolers to go buy Honda Civics and make them wice wockets. But  other than that it's not that great.   It's really corny, you know. It was,  it's, don't watch it. Zero out of five. Fast and the Furious.	5.26
Hey again guys.   xxx I am reviewing today is the movie Team America World Police,  specifically this is the censored and unrated version.    The team who made this is the team  xxx parker.   They were the mind behind South Park, a very popular television show.  And also  the movie xxx,  not so good but    I guess they should really stick to TV because this isn't that good of a movie.     It's all about puppets   sort of the like parody of the old seventies puppet television shows,   but it is not that good   it    it tries to be kind of  sexy   and  taken into account like political themes like Kim Jong Eun    is the bad guy and  there's a bunch of like    celebrities in it who would team up with him because they are like super liberal celebrities.  The plots kind of  but I mean puppets so what do you want.      There are a few funny scenes I guess, most revolves around haha puppets   but, I can't recommend this movie, it's not that good, two out of five.	3.464
This is Blade. This the original in a trilogy of movies  and  basically what it's about is that Wesley Snipes stars as the main character Blade and when he was  when his mother was pregnant with him she was bitten by a vampire so  while she had a baby I guess she was    sometime about phasing into being a vampire but she ,   she ended up dying while giving birth and he ends up having  the powers of a vampire but  none of their weaknesses.  And so  refer to him as the daywalker and  xxx basically they just want to kill him, while one of the other guy probably just wants to   use his blood for a ritual or something along those lines.   This is definitely one of my favorite action movies, I mean it's got so many awesome scenes, the atmosphere's just fantastic. The, I mean the the  fight scenes are choreographed just  ridiculously well.  Wesley Snipes he just does such an amazing job at  playing the character. And  if you haven't seen any of the trilogy then I definitely recommend you start with this first. And I give this movie a very high rating, five out of five, and I I  definitely recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it.	4.359
Hi, today I will be reviewing the movie three hundred which came out in theater like a couple months ago.  I know it's a really old movie  but it's still in theaters. It should be coming out on DVD soon.    It's a very very good movie. Three hundred is about three hundred men   the battle of the xxx  which is like a little history thing  a lot of people running  world history  battle of the xxx three hundred men has to take on   massive like Persian empire and overall they  they they  dramatize it a lot,  there's a special throughout the movie there's a special like film filter that makes it look really dark and gritty and   it's very violent it's very violent  but it's like fake violence you know fake bloody violence it's not that bad    it's very stylized so that's grotesque and overall the movie is really good  there's, there's a bunch of one liners    the story is very   there's not a very big twist in the story if you read the history book and you know how it is that's how the movie goes    bunch of big men really strong, really ripped, and they battle all these Persians and it's very exciting  it's definitely a different   different  feel than most action film this is a action war movie and    overall I give it like a four and a half to five stars. It's a really really movie. I highly recommend it.    There's not much story but  the action is there I mean people watch the action, people watch the fighting and everything is there, the whole completely package and it looks really good.   The style the film of the  movie looks really good and they really bring  bring  the  history books to life basically and whether or not like everything that happened in the movie happened in real life that's another question    I think there's Discovery channels specials for that    or history channels special for that but overall it's a really good movie. I give it a four and a half to five stars. I highly recommend you go watch it   or when it  comes out in DVD soon you should definitely buy it on DVD. Thank You.	5.26
Today I will be talking about The Italian Job.  It stars Charlize Theron and Mark Wahlberg. This one it came out in two-thousand and three, it's in full color, and this one is a fullscreen collector's edition. This movie is a remake of the nineteen-sixty-nine Italian Job and they both kind of have the same concept going on.    It starts off with a group of friends, these guys are, you know, actually thieves and they're stealing a bunch of gold from this guy but part of their team ends up, you know, betraying them and  so suddenly they're not the bad guys anymore and this other guy is and the rest of the movie is just kind of about how they're trying to take back what was theirs and, you know, kind of like.   It's a good movie {laugh}   but  it's full of action, there's lots of car chases, boat chases,  it's a really good movie and even if you don't like action packed movies this one is like, I don't know, there's something about it, it's good. If you're a girl you'll enjoy it if your boyfriend is like "hey let's watch this movie." It's not like those other action packed movies.  It's really good and I definitely recommend it  but  it's rated PG-thirteen for violence and some language. There's no sexuality in it whatsoever so that's good. But it's a good  movie and I recommend it.	4.243
This DVD is Giuseppe Verdi's Rigoletto, which is an opera DVD if you don't know what that is and   I started getting into classical music and opera stuff and I find it easier to watch the opera than to listen to it on CD and  this one's pretty good. The sets are pretty impressive. It's from The Metropolitan Opera    in New York   and it has Placido Domingo who is probably one of the best opera singers around  and I believe this was filmed in the eighties or something like that. Maybe the end of the eighties   and it's about two hours long, maybe a little bit longer. But it kept me captivated throughout the whole thing, which isn't always easy   in opera stuff. This definitely isn't for everyone. If you like opera you probably already know about this. If    you just wanna check it out,  I'd recommend renting something like this cause this one is pretty entertaining compared to some of the other ones and I picked this up for probably about fifteen dollars.  Thank you.	4.69
South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut. I actually got this movie probably about ten years ago. It was a movie I liked to watch when I played hooky to stay home and when I was faking being or being sick.  I watched this movie. It was funny at the time.  As I got older this movie became less and less funny.    I can't really say South Park is stupid,  but it actually is. My girlfriend loves it though.   It's just not that funny,  you know unless you like  jokes dealing with bodily functions and  little kids dropping the f bomb. Actually Cartman's kind of funny. The dealings with Cartman, that makes me smile every time.   The homosexuality between Satan and Saddam  it's not very funny. It's kind of weird.   I actually might need to watch this now that Saddam is actually no longer on this earth, because you can probably kind of picture Saddam being down there with Satan, you know.   You know, I think that's pretty evil really.  So, anyways, South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut, one out of five.	5.354
Hi. Today I am  going to to talk to you about    an excellent movie that I saw  which is Three-Hundred.      Three-Hundred was an awesome movie. It was full of adventure, excitement,  fighting,   blood, gore,  all that good stuff all in one movie.  It's really cool.  One of my favorite parts about the movie was, it was an excellent movie, first off. It's probably one of my favorite movies now.    But was like the   like how they filmed it. Like it was just  so so  neat and like, so different but pretty.  All about it,  the whole movie is just filled with that. It's  so excellent. It's like in between    being like real and being like a painting   but it's still real.  If that makes any sense.  It's very  artistic. It's awesome, excellent. It's about    King    Leonidas  and his   army of three-hundred Spartans. They go and they fight  pretty much the Persian army that is going to attack and try to  take over Spartan and all that stuff.  So basically it's about, you know, them fighting and they,   they do pretty well    til the very end, and not going to ruin that for you, but  go check it out at a theater near you. It's awesome, and it's definitely worth the ticket price.  I believe it's rated R so it may not be the best for kids but for adults definitely should go check it out. It's one of my favorite movies so go see Three-Hundred today. Thanks.	4.359
This is  Star Wars Five:  The Empire Strikes Back widescreen version.   It is  the sequel to  Star Wars: A New Hope which  was the original.    The widescreen version is really great because it's like you're at the movie theater.  It's a lot better than the standard version.  This movie's a little more darker than the first one.  The empire which is the villains  with Darth Vader and  the emperor and everything  they kind of come out on top by the end of this movie.   But it's still a great movie. It starts out with a great  battle scene on a  snow planet with  these  tall walking type of robot creatures.   Luke Skywalker he becomes more of a jedi in this one and he also  learns that Darth Vader is his father. So it's, it's  got famous lines. So if you like  if you like    futuristic movies check out Star Wars Five.	4.082
Hi there. Today we're going to be reviewing Cheaper by the Dozen which is  the original version. There's a second movie out now but this is  Steve Martin  in the first role. It tells the story of  a family with twelve kids and his attempts  to raise them.  Includes Hillary Duff, Bonnie Hunt, Tom Welling and Piper Parabo.   All names that should be familiar with kids and some adults and so this kind of makes the movie have wide appeal. I didn't really like the movie, I thought it was cheesy. I think Steve Martin's done other better things. Ebert and Roper apparently said two thumbs up here on the cover but for me it's probably two thumbs down.   The humor seemed kind of contrived, kind of, you know, slapstick.   The dad's getting hit by the kids or someone's acting up sort of thing. Not all that funny and not all that original and I didn't think the acting was all that great either. But who knows? I  am probably tougher on movies than a lot of people. This was pretty popular  and it's a good choice for like I said kids or families.  So if you're looking for something it's sort of lighthearted.  It's only PG. Cheaper by the Dozen is a good place to look. But for me it only gets two stars out of five. Thanks.	6.351
Hi there, today we're going to be reviewing the DVD of Gladiator which is a  big Russell Crowe film from  late nineteen-nineties.  It won  Academy Awards and it was quite a popular movie.  It tells the story of the gladiator, who is played by Russell Crowe, and his attempts sort of to gain freedom for himself and resist  the emperor  at the time.   It's a really good movie. It's long,  that's a primary complaint against it, it's over two two  and a half hours so you need to have some time to sit down and watch Gladiator, but Russell Crowe does a really good job and he's really believable in the role.  And it's really thoroughly entertaining from start to finish.  It's shot in a  very  cinematic style I guess. I guess all movies can be shot in cinematic style but the photography in this one seemed in particular excellent to me    and it really was just I thought a fantastic movie.  You can the DVD pretty cheap now, it shouldn't be too expensive, it's been out  for several years. But if you haven't seen it and you somehow missed it the first time around it really is a great story    to check out. Definitely not for the kids, it's an adult movie, but   yeah. If you fit in the age group and haven't seen Gladiator go get it. Five stars out of five. Thanks.	5.354
Hi everyone, today I'm going to do my Expo review on this VHS movie called The Princess Diaries.    This is the first of two movies , and it stars Julie Andrews and Anne Hathaway.    This is one of her first movies I've ever seen her in. She's really young.    , and this movie came out,   a little over five years ago.  I loved it, it was so cute. One of the really good Disney movies I've ever seen.  Disney makes good movies.  , it's on VHS, but it's also on DVD and you can probably get it for about fifteen dollars, maybe ten dollars because it's pretty, pretty old.  It's not that recent or new, but there's also a sequel to it,  Princess Diaries Two.  , It was okay, but this is the better of the two.  And it's about a normal girl, high school girl that transforms herself into a princess  because she's actually a princess because her dad  was the king of some, little country.  Definitely check it out if you like the old good heart, , good-hearted movies by Dinesy.   And it's called Princess Diaries. Thanks.	2.708
Hey Expo.    Have you ever seen this movie shaggy dog?    Walt Disney    it's  okay this movie.    I saw it at the movie theater at the dollar theater luckily because I wasn't very impressed by it.  I mean   you know Tim Allen is pretty funny in it but  the movie itself is so cheesy like  it's just   it's just  really cheesy and it says it's going to be a ruff day, get it? Ruff day.    Like Tim Allen turns into this shaggy dog like he literally turns into this dog. He starts acting like a dog and it's just like,  what? What are you doing? It's just really cheesy but, kids, you know, laugh over it and think it's really funny but,  you know as an adult,   it'd probably put you to sleep so if you are looking on to stay up with your kids like, don't run it because or don't buy it because it's much like dogs laugh.  but it's just kinda cheesy so I'm going to just give it two out of five star rating a two so you know take that into consideration.   Yeah two.	5.26
Hi. I'm going to review for you today the movie Evan Almighty.   This movie I guess is supposed to be the sequel to Bruce Almighty, but it's pretty much completely different  and doesn't mention the first movie at all. The only thing that's the same is Morgan Freeman is still God {laugh} and I think   yeah I think that's pretty much the only thing, like the same people did it, but   like  obviously Bruce doesn't  Evan almighty doesn't get God's powers or any of that like in the first one. God just asks him to build an ark and says that if anybody asks there's a flood coming and  he starts to do it because  God makes it very hard for him to do his job as he's a congressman.  Newly appointed congressman and   basically he can't do anything else for the time unless he builds this ark and there's a lot of funny moments and  it's not as good as Bruce Almighty I would say and they kind of stretched it a little too far but it's definitely really good for kids and there's a lot of funny moments, so it was alright. It wasn't, it wasn't  too great.	2.0
Hi, today I'm reviewing this movie.   This movie is called Serenity.   This is  the widescreen edition.   This movie was  written and directed by Joss Whedon,  and it's basically the culmination of his storyline for his tv show Firefly.   It has to do with    a a  spaceship and its crew flying in the far reaches of space in an  alternate future.    It's a dystopian world where    there's kind of an evil governmental  group that seeks control of    everyone's comings and goings and these guys are kind of rebels and outlaws.   They fly around in the ship and do what they want. They're kind of mercenaries, smugglers,   whatever they can do to make a buck.    And this movie is, like I said, the finale of all the plotlines that were supposed to be finished in the   in the  cancelled tv series, so there's a lot of a lot of   subtext there for you if you go ahead and watch Firefly first and then watch Serenity you'll really know what's going on. But I think the movie stands on its own.   I've spoken with some people who've only seen the movie and they really enjoyed it just for what it was.   It makes itself clear enough.    I've got a soft spot in my heart for this I had to give it a really high rating because I liked it so much and I think the characters are great.    The the  actors are perfect for the roles and    some really, really memorable characters in here.    Jane and    just everybody on the ship is really memorable.   I give it   a huge thumbs up and a big five, you should watch this movie. Really good sci-fi, they don't make them like this very often.	5.745
This is the Borat movie and    well  this is Sacha Baron Cohen and    Borat, as Borat and the Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan and    this is the widescreen of course and  it's just   this is a hilarious hilarious movie. It just    Sacha Baron Cohen does a great job with all his characters, but Borat especially.   And  basically,   yeah.  It it's , If you've ever seen  Borat clips on his show, then you just,  like a movie kind of,  that he goes to the US and does these ridiculous things.  I mean, he just, I don't even know how he can do some of the things that he does. It's just funny.    Like running butt naked through a dining room butt naked filled with you know,  it looked like at least over a hundred people and then wrestling with another man naked in front of everybody. But    the scenes,  just completely ridiculous what goes on in this movie and it's all just so funny.    There's deleted scenes, there's a xxx xxx and there's a music infomercial.   If you've never seen Borat The Movie I highly , even if you haven't seen the the   clips from the show, I highly recommend it cause it's a very funny movie and I give it a five out of five.	3.464
Did a review on the Care Bears Movie. This movie is rated G.   Everybody loves the Care boar, Care Bears.  I remember as a kid,  the care bears were    a big thing. They were just coming out,  everybody had a care bear doll, they had care bear cartoons.   Well, this is the Care Bear movie. I mean, it's  a pretty good movie.   The world's in trouble and it's  up to the Care Bears to save it, and, you know,  Care Bears   care about everybody. They have their different,   different characteristics  that they show,  but  in this one they're,    they're  trying to save the world.  Now  this does have voices of Mickey Rooney,    Georgia Engel of , also its got songs that are  performed by Carol King.  But in this movie,  it's great for  young kids,  so I do recommend picking it up.  Again  they're trying to, you know,  save the world.  They watch over the earth and  make sure everybody's kind and friendly,  make sure nobody's upset or anything.   And I mean even when evil  comes around,  they still try to make everybody happy and  make people nice and everything.  So I do recommend picking this up for your kids or, I mean, as a family you can watch it. Again that's the Care Bears Movie.	2.708
Hi, this is my review of this movie, Six Days and Seven Nights.  Which is a nineties Harrison Ford, semi-action, more romantic comedy flick. Despite how serious he look here on the cover there's not a lot of action going on. It's him and Anne Heche.  She's the love interest.   pretty funny but  all in all, not   not worth the price of admission.  This is the DVD widescreen edition  so you can actually enjoy the full aspect. It was actually some good scenery in this. Some good stuff to watch.  But   Harrison Ford plays his  normal character, a gruff cargo pilot. Mine as well be Han Solo in the Caribbean.    His character hates tourist, so of course he has to spend a week with Anne Heche, a tourist, and they have some romantic involvement.  They get stranded together on a deserted isle. It's kind of  Castaway like, except Castaway is really good.    I give this a two. I can't really honestly give it anything better than that.  So, a two out of five for the widescreen version of Six Days, Seven Nights.	4.435
{noise} I'm going to do a movie review of Three-Hundred.   It is pretty much a remake of an old   older movie they made, Three-Hundred, like years ago. I just recently found this out. This movie was released in early March of two-thousand-seven and   it's an action adventure,   little bit of drama, full of war in it  and  basically it's about the   an old, ancient  civilization Spartans. They really didn't live very long as a society cause they were kind of like a a  warlike society that could fight, that's what they're based on. And  in the beginning you kind of see  the child  which will be the king. The child kind of grows up learning how to fight, learning how to control himself and  on an early age he's thrown out of,   you know, away from his family so he can learn how to survive. This guy's a strong, strong guy. When he becomes king  he's faced with the  Persian  army  threat. They they  come and say, you know, if you don't give us what we want pretty much you're gonna be destroyed, and he doesn't accept this to start with. He's like, you know, "No, I don't think so." So      you know,  his, his people really, you know, they don't want to fight. I mean he he  has to go with throughout the politics of the society, he can't just do what he wants. And they don't want to do it, so what he does is he gets three-hundred of  the best guys he can think of to    go out and fight    the Persians. And there, you know, there are a lot of Persians. Huge, huge amount. An army that come with them. It's a really good movie. It It's  just, it's dark,   it's just great war movie. Lot of  good fight scenes. It's just an, it's a really awesome movie. If I was to give this a rating it's an A plus plus plus. This is, by far, one of the best movies I've seen.  War type movie.  It's really good.     They couldn't go wrong with this movie. It's produced by  Frank Miller, which he does always does a great job  and I just I like this movie a lot. I recommend this highly to watch. Awesome movie.	4.69
Hi, My name is Nalin and I will be reviewing for you  Stephen King's IT. So  I'll take a closer look. So this is a movie about the   a clown basically as you can see on the DVD cover right here and   this clown is  out to get children and   that that  is the basic plot of this movie and this movie starts out. I'm not even sure whether this is a movie or what but   this movie starts out in a town, in a small town and   it shows this clown that's been  really wicked clown and   he takes under from farms and seven kids get together  in  their childhood and  then they want to reunite because  this clown is bad. So the basic thing about   naming this thing IT, the movie, is that the clown, they named the clown as IT.  Now the thing about this movie is it's too slow,  it's too slow  and it's total of three hours of  play and  it's just really too slow so I did not even watch the whole thing,  but  I could make out towards end what's going to happen so  that's the basic plot that   they are out to kill this clown holds six or seven people are out to kill this ghost so that's the basic plot and   the movie is too slow, very,  gets boring at times and it's not even  very scary so I did not like this movie  and  I only end up rating this one out of five.	5.066
I'll be reviewing  the movie Spider-Man Three which is currently in the theaters, which is the third and looked like the final, you know, these the Spider-Man trilogy but there might be more made with different actors or even a different director, it's hard to say.  And you know I was pretty, I was looking forward to this movie you know quite a bit.  You know I was a big fan of the first so that they were done pretty well, you know, with Sam Raimi directing  it's pretty much, you know, the perfect choice, you know, for the, for the  movies in that, you know, he didn't take them too seriously, you know he knew how to joke around with the makeup, kind of, you know, goofy and kind of like booky and that kind of thing and it really worked for the  first two. I mean they always had good villains with like Alfred Molina playing   Doctor Octopus and, you know,  that kind of thing.  But for some reason the third one really fell apart.  They had too many villains and it was just really hokey and it felt like they were just trying to do way, I mean, really it felt like it was two movies  they tried to cram into one and  they didn't give enough time to relay anything.  I mean Peter Parker's character, you know, was  even, you know, when controlled by the symbiote  it's just  it's just kind of a big mess. I just really left the theater feeling just kind of . And the more and more I thought about it, the more and more I just really hated the movie. It's just, it's a bad movie , you know? With bad characterizations. The acting surprisingly enough was actually worse than the first two which is really saying something, you know, it's probably the definitely the weakest point of the first two movies. And  it's just a big puddle of, you know, mess. Even the action sequences aren't as good as  the first and the second one so I gotta say it purp , I will, don't know if I say it ruined the trilogy. Well, it ruined the trilogy, I don't know if it ruined the first two movies for me. But if you haven't seen it yet and you are a big Spider-Man fan, you know, I'd probably say it's, you're probably okay to just avoid it.	7.0
This is my review of a movie currently in theaters and that movie being Evan Almighty.  I was a huge fan of the original film Bruce Almighty but I did think it was funny. Like Jim Carey, Morgan Freeman and I like Steve Carell too so I figured okay you know the sequel will be pretty good.  Then I heard that it was gonna have like a, it was going way over budget, it was going to be two-hundred and fifty million. Then I was thinking  I don't know how a comedy can really be two-hundred fifty million but you know, I guess with all this hype it's worth seeing.  And I'm afraid it wasn't.   All the money they seem to have spent on a giant arc and a bunch of live animals.   There seems to be a ton of CG but there also seems to be a ton of real animals and I'm not sure why they would have blown all that money when they could have just you know CG's it all, because the animals really weren't that impressive.  It's definitely geared towards kids, the story isn't as well done, as Bruce Almighty, seems to have targeted even a younger crowd.  Like, I mean there's a lot of animal poop jokes in there that really   didn't need to be there. There's definitely better ways to go about humor than making you know really unfunny jokes, and there's a lot of moments like that. The story sucks, the characters were really wooden and plain and I liked some of the actors and actresses,  so I'm not sure what was going on there.   It just seems like a really lousy effort by everybody and    I guess the box office is reflecting that. Unfortunately, it seems like it'll be a good bomb.   So I'm gonna have to give Evan Almighty a two out of five.	4.69
My children and I recently went to see the movie Surf's Up.    I was very disappointed in it.   It  was a commentary.   It was a cartoon, of course, but it was kinda like a commentary. The penguin was being interviewed about things that had happened in the past.   It did not hold the attention of my five year old. She was ready to leave  when it was half over.    We were at the drive in and it was the first movie and there was another movie coming, so there was no way we could leave.   It used  words that I don't like my children to use.  even though they're not considered curse words,  they were using the word    poop and crap   things like that. People or  the penguins were passing gas.   Just some untasteful things in the movie.   And in my opinion,  too, I think we've had enough  penguin movies made in the last year.  I've had my fill of it.   So, I would highly recommend that you save your money.   Find another movie to take your kids to because this one was a total let down.	4.83
I recently got to see the movie TMNT.  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  movie.  not necessarily by choice. We happened to go to the drive in and it happened to be the second movie on and we happened to have some little friends with us that were little boys so needless to say we stayed and watched the movie.   The little boys liked it, the little girls fell asleep.  I couldn't wait til it was over, but you know if you have little boys then, you know, they probably would like this movie.   It might be one to wait though, and not go to the movie  theater and see, but I would wait for it to come out on video and then maybe rent the video. I don't think it would be worth taking the whole family to the movies to see it.   I don't know, it was just kind of boring. Maybe it's just because I don't have little boys so I'm not really into the little   characters like that.   Wasn't too long, wasn't too short, just,  just couldn't get into it.	4.243
Hi, my name is Anaj, and today I'm reviewing the movie Ratatouille which is on theaters nationwide.   It's a animation movie and it's about a rat.  His name is Remy. And  this this  guy's into  cooking and, you know, he he  can tell what are the ingredients in in  any kind of food and , you know, he used to visit this old lady's house where he saw on TV his  hero  I think his name was   Gustav. And, you know, Gustav was the, like, the best chef and  he has this own restaurant. But the other rats kinda, you know, don't want him to do that. In fact after they   find out that this guy can actually tell the ingredients he was kind of the poison tester, just to check if the food has poison or not. Well  anyways he he  somehow lands up into Paris and he gets to this Gustav's restaurant and  there's this new kid who has just joined and he's the sweeper  at the place and he's trying to cook but he can't. And the two of them kind of team up and, you know, they they  come up with such nice recipes and, you know, the critics were saying bad things about the Gustav restaurant and now that's good. So check out this movie, it's a five on five, really good movie, really fun and  watch it in theaters. Again this is a review of Ratatouille.	4.359
Hi everyone, I'm Rebecca, and I'm here today to review the new movie in theaters called Ratatouille.   It is from Walt Disney and Pixar  and so it is obviously for children and adults alike.   Pixar's put out a lot of wonderful movies in the past ten years or so,  starting with, like, Toy Story and A Bug's Life and  they've just done a lot of fun movies for kids and the great thing about Pixar movies is   not just the kids enjoy them but the adults enjoy them as well, and this one was no exception.   Ratatouille is about a little rat  in Paris  who has this desire to be more, has this desire to be more than just your regular rat who steals food and,  you know, squanders stuff wherever he can  and invades everybody's house, that kind of thing. He wants to be a chef. He has this amazing talent for   tasting food, and appreciating the finer points of food, and he wants to be a chef. He gets himself in a position where he can  be in a kitchen, a chef's kitchen,   and the story kind of revolves around his journey   to helping a human being become a better chef   by using his own talents as a rat who knows a lot about food. Sounds totally weird   when you think about the story line, but it's so cute.   This little Ratatouille rat    I think his name is Remi,  in the movie he becomes very good friends with this want to be chef and they help each other, basically, you know they help each kind of realize their dreams and  it's just very precious, it's very sweet,  and you laugh and laugh and laugh.    It's just, you know, the whole idea of it is funny, but when   the end, you know comes,  when the end gets there you will have an appreciation for  everybody being able to follow their dreams no matter how  crazy they seem, or how out of reach it seems  for a different individual. So    I would say definitely see it, I would give it five stars, it's a great family movie. My little boy enjoyed it, he's six,   and I enjoyed it and   I think it's definitely one of Disney's and Pixar's best so  if you get a chance, go see it. That's my review of Ratatouille.	4.967
Alright Napoleon Dynamite.   Pretty much everyone has seen this movie,  but if you haven't yet,  it's  something you should definitely see and definitely buy.  Excuse me. It's a very,   it's a very good collectors item   it's a really funny movie.  Real great comedy,  good for people of all ages  as well. It's not just a, it's not a typical children's movie  where it's kind of unintellectual  humor, that only kids would find funny.   Adults can find it too because I'm eighteen years old and I was laughing the whole way through it.    The the the  character Napoleon Dynamite he's a very unique    character something I I  had never seen in a movie before. He's  a high school student   with a very vivid imagination  and he he  draws things that  seems like an an  elementary schooler would draw.   The movie it seems to take place sometime back in the nineties.  It's kind of old-fashioned in terms of   today's  modern, modernization.  But    basically this guy, he's he's  from the lovable loser   and he doesn't have too many friends until partway through the movie when he meets the   the new kid in school  and he becomes friends with him  and eventually  they meet   a girl   and then the three of them    go on a quest to try and make the new kid the class president.   And that's pretty much the most there is in terms of a story.   But  they follow other characters in the movie such as  his brother Kip,   and his uncle named Rico.   And they all kind of have their different story and the movie follows each one of them, they each have   you know, unique original personas that this, that the movie follows.  And  very well done, very original movie and very funny.  Overall I think I   probably give it a   four point eight stars out of five. So   Napoleon Dynamite, go buy it.	4.83
Hello Expo Tv this is Tyson, and  this is my review for The Day After Tomorrow   widescreen edition. Now    this movie is   is basically about if global warming continued at such levels  to where  worldwide catastrophe in the form of  multiple hurricanes, tornadoes and ultimately a huge ice age would bring it.   It's a little ridiculous   from that standpoint because who actually you know, believes it that this could actually happen.   But it does take an interesting look as if it did happen and the special effects are  out of this world really, they are   they they  spent top dollar on this    on this movie. It was directed by   byRoland Emmerich and    he he's  known for his work in kind of the  extremism I suppose.    But I, I  guess this movie warrants a watch    if nothing else for the  spectacular   special effects, seeing New York City  going into a ice age is something you will never forget    even though you may want to because it's kind of ridiculous.    I I'll  read to you actually  some of the tag lines  that came out of this movie. This is my favorite one.   {cough} Who ever said tomorrow is another day didn't check the weather.   I mean, as lame and as corny as that is, you pretty much get an idea for how the whole movie is.    But  it's it's  good fun to watch  with friends you know, because I think by yourself watching this you might just you might not get to the end because you might wanna laugh at it.    I give it one thumbs up and the other thumb is an icy   thumbs down.	4.435
This review is for Live Free Die Hard, currently in theaters.  I  Sean  give it thumbs up.  I really liked it,  I didn't even see any of the other Die Hard movies but  I guess you didn't need to to  enjoy this one, because I enjoyed this one.  Does that make sense? Okay   It had the   the guy from the Apple ads, you know the Mac versus, Mac versus PC?  Anyways he's good at muttering under his breath and  just being a smartass. And he's pretty funny   comparison with Bruce Willis  and  made the movie funny and there was a lot of action.  I really liked  when   the guy pushed another guy in this grinder and  he killed the cop, the helicopter with a car just like {explosion noise}  and  the turned off the lights in the tunnel, I don't know.  It's a cool movie,  recommend it, you should   you should check it out.   It's still in theaters I think and   try to go right now.	5.745
Hi, my name is Rebecca and I'm reviewing for you today the movie Ratatouille.   It's one of the Disney Pixar movies  and it's just really good.   Basically Ratatouille's about like this mouse in France, this rat in France who,   he's like a really good cook but obviously he's a rat so like what could he do with it?   But there's this also like this other like human chef but he's not a really like good at cooking.  So then Ratatouille and him team up   and they like cook together.   It's just really interests , it's really funny like  it's one of the Pixar movies so you know it's gonna be funny and you know it's gonna be really well animated. And    and this movie is just really well animated. Like all the scenery and like the food looked really  legitimately real, like I was really amazed. And    it's just a really funny   movie and it's really family friendly so I would really recommend anyone to see it of any age.	2.517
Hi, I'm here today to talk about the movie Live Free or Die Hard.   This is the fourth movie in the Die Hard installment. Bruce Willis returns as officer John McClane.   If you like the Die Hard movies, you'll like this one. There's a lot of action,  a lot of unbelievable action.   If you like the Die Hard movies before you'll have to remember some of things that that  has done some of the stunts that they've done are just unbelievable, larger than life. It's carried on with this movie. There's some big stunts and some things that that  happen, you just thinking no way. But you gotta look back to the other Die Hard movies and remember  some of the things that John McClane has been through, this is just another day in the life of this character.    One thing I think is really cool is they reintroduced the character of Lucy  Gennero McClane, which is John McClane's daughter. She's got a part in this it's really cool.  Kevin Smith fans, Kevin Smith is in it. He plays a really cool part.  I don't wanna give the movie away but I think for Die Hard fans you'll think it's really cool. If you're not a Die Hard fan you might not appreciate some of the stunts. Like I said, they're larger than life and a little bit unbelievable, but if you like Bruce Willis and if you like Die Hard like I do you're gonna love this film. Thank you.	6.403
Probably one of my favorite DVDs is   Hugh Jackman's performance in Oklahoma.      A good video tool for several reasons,   one being that it's hilarious to see Hugh Jackman   playing  curly.   I believe he is,   I haven't seen it in a while.    Also Hugh Jackman can sing very, very well.    Unbeknownst to me.    The the  production of this is the let's see.   The royal it's on here somewhere.   The royal London screen actors something like that, the royal, royal academy of yeah, stage actors or something like that so they're all these really you know,    pumped up British dudes who   are acting as if they have    down home American accents which is really very classy.    It's always kind of weird watching   a stage production on film. They don't quite translate very well.    But they actually use   pretty good  pretty good use of camera angles and   so forth to make it sort of seem   like an actual film adaptation and not just a camcorder version    you know held up taping a show.   So if you have to buy   a DVD of Oklahoma,   you should get   Hugh Jackman.	4.082
Hi, Summer Banks here and today I'm reviewing for you, the DVD Vanilla Sky with Tom Cruise.  Tom Cruise is in this movie with Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz. The movies is rated R for sexuality and strong language and is brought to you by Paramount pictures.  Now I have to let you know  I'm giving this movie two stars. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because I've watched it approximately five times and I still have absolutely zero idea what really happened.  This is a thriller.   There are   events that take place that you don't know if they're real, if they're not real.   There are finales that aren't really finales. There are beginnings and events that aren't really there. There's some that are there that you  don't see til later on.   I I  cannot explain this movie in any way shape or form because I simply did not understand it.   Now as for the shooting and the acting, it was fantastic. The movie was acted very well   and I was very comfortable in that regard but,  the simple story line was too difficult for me to follow.   So, as I said, Vanilla Sky is receiving two stars from me and that's pushing it.  It's probably more like one and a half. So I would not recommend Vanilla Sky in your DVD collection.	6.683
This is a review of the movie Spider-Man three.    What a way to end the trilogy.   Let's see the first Spider-Man film was pretty good, half of it was at least. The second one was silly and this one was worse.   Not only was it excessively long and  had way too many characters in it,   Spider-Man three just  lacked substance on all levels I would say.  Tobey Maguire  clearly didn't want to be doing this role anymore. Kirsten Dunst  I don't know if she could ever act. She couldn't  at the very least she wasn't acting in this film.   The direction, it was   Sam Raimi, I I  just don't understand. I guess  something happened. Like he used to be at least an interesting director what what  with like  you know, the Evil Dead trilogy. But, I mean, then again those were very campy films. This is  summer blockbuster so I don't know, maybe his artistic talent maybe just doesn't translate. But anyway   plot was hopelessly absurd    and uninteresting to boot   and  yeah. I I  don't even know why they introduced Venom. He showed up and then bam, he was gone.   Hopefully I didn't spoil it for anybody.  Anyways, for the positives about this film    Stan Lee does another cameo,  which was a little bit funny.  Alright so I give this film, two out of five stars.	4.243
This is a review of the movie Hostel Part two.   Well, what to say about this film.   Surely, surely  wasn't hostile.  Hostel was,   it wasn't scary, but it was gruesome and  kind of had some dark humor to it and a fairly interesting plot.    Hostel two pretty much rehashed the plot of one except it made it about women.   going to the infamous hostel which leads to their demise, ultimately to their demise. But    Yeah, I was  I just felt it was very rehashed. It It's  been done already. The violence in this film was  exponentially worse I would say. Not exponentially no,   probably geometrically though. It was worse, but at the same time it was very  forced, almost pornographic is a term that's thrown around a lot that I agree with. It's an accurate description.  And   I didn't care about any of the characters in this film unlike the protagonist from the first one so.   I'd give Hostel Part two  two stars out of five.	4.082
Hi, I'm Kristen and this is my review of the movie Ratatouille.   My husband and I went to the movies on his birthday and he wanted to see Die Hard and we got up there and it was sold out. Last minute we went and saw Ratatouille. I really really liked it. We both enjoyed it. The animation was great.   Yeah it's a kid movie, but it's Pixar. Pixar movies are always good.    As far as like, rating against other Pixar movies, it was definitely better than Cars.   The story was really cute. You, it made me really hungry afterwards. It was funny.   I I  will buy it probably on DVD for my kids to watch,  when it comes out.  I wanna say it was definitely worth the price of admission.    Just a fun movie that I can genuinely recommend that everyone should go see. On a scale of one to four, I would give it four stars. I really really appreciate the effort and creativity that goes into making  any Pixar films. I like I like  Ratatouille too because this Summer I feel like all the movies I've seen so far in theaters have been sequels and they've been so lousy. Like Shrek The Third was lame, Pirates  three was bad,   Spider-Man three was okay. But like, for the most part Ratatouille is just great and it was an original movie and it made me excited to go to the theater and I didn't feel like I was ripped off.   So that's my review of Ratatouille  and I'm Kristen. Enjoy.	5.745
Pixar studios is the , movie making outfit  that's made Toy Story, A Bugs Life, , just many many  great movies.    Monsters Inc., for kids and families.  What I love about Pixar is that, the movies are not dumb.  They  they don't talk down to the kids,  they, but they don't keep things over,  way too far over their heads,  but the whole time they make the movies fun and interesting for parents.  We went to go see Ratatouille this weekend,  which is a new movie from Disney Pixar.  And it is about, the story about Ramey the rat who lives in Paris.  , who has, an ability, he becomes a gourmet cook.  He partners with a young French man who has no cooking ability whatsoever whose name is,  the man's name is Linguini.  And they get together and they,  they find their dream. I mean without giving away too much of the story, this is a great family film.  That, you know, we all enjoyed.  My fourteen year old daughter enjoyed it  and, that says a lot because you know,   teenagers tend to be sort of cynical about everything.  She had a great time.  My eleven year old daughter enjoyed it.  My husband and I enjoyed it.  It's a good story.  It's got a great message.  It's funny.  the the  , animation is beautiful. It shows ,  scenes from Paris that make you feel like you're there.  I cannot recommend Ratatouille enough. I think that if you're looking for a good movie  to go to as a family, this is it.  Go see Ratatouille, you'll love it.	6.403
I took my  children today to see the movie Ratatouille   and I just wanted to let you know that I thought it was really cute. I enjoyed it as did both my children. One is five years old and one is ten years old. And it's about a rat who wants to cook, wants to be a chef. Well obviously  rats in the kitchen is something that you don't want to see.  Well this little rat gets the chance to be a chef, sort of. He   he gets to direct a,  a kid, kind of a loser that really doesn't know how to cook, but he's up in his hat and he gets to, to  direct his body and tell him what to do.   But it's pretty cute. It's rated G.   I think it's well worth taking your little ones to.  There was no violence, no cuss words, just nothing. There was a couple of kissing scenes between a couple of the cartoon characters, which my five year old told me after the show why did there have to be kissing in that movie? So anyway I give it a five.    Especially out of all the movies that I've seen  for kids so far this summer.	6.055
This review is for the movie Dead Silence.  I got this movie because  I like horror movies every now and then and it says from the writer and director of Saw.  I really liked Saw, I thought Saw was a pretty interesting original movie so I thought this would be good too.    but I was very disappointed by this movie.  There, it's just it's  there's a lot of stuff that doesn't make any sense   and a lot of stuff that just seems to be there just for the the  sake of the story   like wouldn't happen otherwise.   I mean I understand in movies that you have to suspend, you know   disbelief  for the sake of the story but when it, when it  there is nothing on it to hold on to, then it kind of truth or reality then it kind of just becomes nothing you know, waste of time.  That's kind of what this movie became.  And  as I was watching the extended features, they were talking about how great the sets were, how you know how, how  all the stuff they did was incredible and   and I think they put more emphasis on the look of the movie rather than the actual movie itself and story line and everything else.  And another thing that   I I  kind of realize why the movie wasn't that great cause it kind of didn't,   really not make any sense to me.  It really seem like it was going all over. And it had an alternate ending and when I watched it,  I kinda realized now the, the  actual, alternate ending kinda, could have made the movie go into two different directions   and because they had two endings in mind, I think that they didn't really get a grasp on the actually theme of the story, what it should be from start to finish.   Like the great xxx said,  if you have more than one ending for a story, you're in trouble   and I think that holds true with this.  I wouldn't recommend it, there's really not anything scary in it.  They try to have little scary moments that you have seen in every other horror movie,   you know, knock offs of of  the kind of scare tactics that other movies have used and they don't even do a good job with that.  So I didn't find this movie scary.  I kinda found it ridiculous and pointless.	6.403
Hi, this is my movie review of the movie  License to Wed starring Mandy Moore.  This is a movie I though was going to be pretty funny because the trailer looked pretty funny and it's got you know Robin Williams, which I personally like and thought you know he's gonna bring some entertainment to this movie. But I didn't really like this movie at all. It was boring.   The plot  It was like it didn't have a plot. It was just they are trying to you know create all these things to make you laugh but I don't think it was funny at all. Even the robotic baby part was supposed to be funny, it didn't turn out to be funny in the film. It looked funny in the clip for the trailer but didn't seem funny at all. And   you know Mandy Moore's character is kind of like, you feel like her character's unrealistic because what type of girl would go that hard core to you know to get married in this church and it just seemed unrealistic and she gets all in a hissy fit and it's just really really tiring and stressful movie. And it wasn't and I feel like the characters were underdeveloped. They're you don't like any of the characters. You don't connect with any of the characters. And  It felt like the you know there's like  just a little bit just way too typical of a boring film that tries really hard to be funny but it's just not funny at all and it's not it's not  witty. It it's  not even romantic you know in a way that, the way it's written it's like how can someone you know go that hard. It's just like at the end when you're done with the movie you don't even believe in the original premise of the movie. You don't believe that someone can actually you know believe in the priest and just wanted get married that badly in that church. And be you know believe everything in the priest, it's just kind of like, the movie's stressful. I don't know if it's the acting or the way the characters are characterized. It's just really boring, bland film that even the plot it didn't really have anything going on for that. So   For those who are interested, I definitely do not recommend this movie at all. I mean I mean  if you're really bored and if you're looking for something to do, the last resort and if you wanna go to a movie theater, pick any movie but this one, because it seemed like a very interesting movie but it turns out to be just very bland.	5.26
My review is on   Ocean's Thirteen.  I saw Ocean's Eleven and Ocean's Twelve and I really like those. All of the movies have George Clooney, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt   and so you know, they're nice to look at but  Ocean's Eleven and Twelve were good. Ocean's Thirteen  not good at all. I don't like it. I thought the other two were pretty exciting.  And  not a lot of people liked Ocean's Twelve but I still liked it.   Ocean's Thirteen, not exciting at all. They had some complications that   were pretty small and were resolved pretty quickly without any  drama or anything. It was just   not exciting, at all.  So if you're going to go see a movie, I would not recommend that. If you don't see it, you're not missing anything.   So,  I would not recommend to see Ocean's Thirteen.	6.403
License to Wed. I was, I was  really excited to see this movie.  I'm a huge fan of The Office and Jim was in it so I I  was definitely on board to see the movie. And  it's also got Robin Williams in it who's hilarious. Mandy Moore, she's really good in in  the few movies I've seen her in, but back to this movie.  Let let's  go over the gist of the movie. Gist of the movie is Mandy Moore and Jim, I don't know his real name,  I'll just call him Jim for. {clears throat} Are are  getting married but in order to get married at a certain church they have to pass the    reverend's    marriage test that's to prove they're compatible. And  they have three weeks to do it in. And and    Robin Williams is the pastor and he he  puts them through tests. And   I didn't enjoy the movie, I I  really didn't, and I really wanted to. Maybe it was because I had too much high hopes and  I think  Jim was okay in it, Robin Williams wasn't his normal funny self to me. I don't know, maybe I'm getting tired of him, but I mean, he wasn't all that funny. The funniest person in the whole movie is   the little kid in the movie. And  I have no idea what his name is, but   he's in  some new movie coming out, I've seen him in it, he was on Jay Leno the other night. He was hilarious in the movie and   the the  rest of the movie, you know,  it could me just going into the movie thinking it's going to be too good but, I mean there were a couple funny parts but it just seemed like  like    they were trying to be funny. Funnier, more than being funny. And  I'll say on a scale of one to ten it's maybe a four. Maybe a four. It wasn't very good.	3.873
Hi, my name is Nalin. I will be reviewing for you the in theaters movie  Live Free or Die Hard. So I haven't   seen the earlier versions of the Die Hard movies, this is the first one I'm seeing and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Now I, I  always enjoy comedy movies and animated movies mostly, but I am very choosy and picky about my, about the action movies I like but I love this one. Live Free or Die hard is an excellent movie with wonderful action, just excellent. And    from what I heard from people, some people said  the Die Hard,  the earlier versions were good, better, because   the  Bruce Willis, John McClane, right? He is  not very invincible in the earlier versions but  in this one he is. That's what the people say but I think he was pretty fine, he wasn't that bad really, he wasn't that superheroish. He was pretty good. The acting performance everybody was very good. The action was spectacular. I just love this movie and I recommend that you should watch it and    definitely watch it in theaters. A great movie. And   well I think the only one thing I did not like about this movie was that towards the end there is a fighter plane scene, so that's kind of going over the top.  Not believable but  I will not take any points away from the movie. I just thoroughly enjoyed the movie, so it's a great movie. You should really go and watch it in theaters and I rate Live Free or Die Hard  five out of five. Thank you.	5.196
Ratatouille is the new Pixar movie that came out this summer.  I was really excited for it. And  I didn't see it opening day. I saw it a few weeks later, maybe. And, no, actually, maybe, maybe  within the week. But I didn't see it as soon as I wanted to.   It's a story about, a CG movie, obviously. It's Pixar.  About a rat living in Paris. And it's voiced by Patton Oswalt, who I don't normally like, but I think he did a pretty good job. And it's directed by Brad Bird, who did The Incredibles, which was probably my favorite Pixar movie.    The movie was really cute. The CG was good. And  it was just funny and  interesting the whole time. But I don't feel like it could have, it was the best Pixar movie, like some people are saying.  Maybe, maybe  second best easily, but not the, not the  best.    That's it.	3.109
This is Dustin with a video review of the movie Three Hundred.  That is currently in theaters.   Another great movie   it's it's  basically about the Spartan army, it's a small Spartan army it's not the whole army it's just three hundred of them, that's where they get the term three hundred from for the title.  It's about these three hundred elite guys that are basically like the bomb and they've been trained from like birth   to fight and and to kill and everything like that.   But basically it's about them standing up to the Persian army which is this huge, massive,   crazy army who have like,   I mean they have humans but they also have like these monsters and like,   I I  don't even know what you would consider them but,   huge like elephants with like,   huge tusks and things but.   Basically a more    larger army and a more advanced army with    with weapons and such. But   basically it's about them standing up to this Persian army when everyone else wants to back down.    And it's actually based off of a true story which makes the movie even that much cooler.   It's done by the same producer that did Sin City so it's a little bit like    I don't wanna say cartoony but  a little bit   eerie and dark.    You'll just have to see it for yourself, there's, it's rated R for a good reason, lots of blood lots of killing and sweet.   I would give this movie a five out of five.	5.686
Hello, my name is Mike and today I am going to be talking to you about the movie License to Wed.  This is that new movie starring   Robin Williams.  Basic premise of the movie, this couple gets engaged, wants to go and get married at horrible church  but  the new standards there require that the priest approve  the wedding beforehand and  the priest makes them go through all kinds of crazy stuff to get his approval.  Okay {sigh} so when you look at this movie,  Robin Williams can actually be a reasonably funny guy  but for him to be really funny in a movie  isn't enough.  For it to be a good movie itself has to be funny, you can't just rely on the fact that he's a funny guy  and that's what this movie does.  The humor in the movie is just horrible,  the plot is not that good or well rounded. It just kinda feels like someone slapped it together and in the end you know having a big name comedian doesn't save you in the end.  So,  License to Wed starring Robin Williams,  one out of five. You may be funny on your own  but you weren't funny enough in this movie.  This movie is an avoider.  I E avoid it.	5.099
Corbin here, reviewing a movie currently in theaters, Hot Fuzz.  Hot Fuzz is a British movie from the creators of the comedy Shaun of the Dead, and it basically has the same actors same directors that were in Shaun of the Dead.   And basically Hot Fuzz is about  a hot shot cop that gets sent to a   city a  small city in Britain I believe that is   the lowest crime rate and  throughout the movie he reveals that the city is not really what it seems.  It's very funny, it's very entertaining and I really enjoyed it.  There's a lot of action in it but it doesn't take itself seriously.   It is kind of violent. It has a lot of gruesome parts. It is rated R I believe.  But   overall it is really funny.   It's good to see a comedy like that when there aren't a lot nowadays   and if you liked Shaun of the Dead, definitely recommend checking it out.  But    overall, I give it two thumbs up and I think you should  give it a chance if you are willing to try and find it in a theater near you, cause it is kind of limited. But   check it out, Hot Fuzz.	5.745
This is The Bourne Supremacy starring  Matt Damon.  He is a really good actor.   This is yeah the second in the trilogy   the first movie is called the Bourne  Identity and then the third one is the Bourne Ultimatum  which hasn't come out yet but it, it's  about to, I just saw some previews for it.   It's a fairly long movie, well actually not really about two hours.  And   very high paced  and intense action scenes.  Really sweet action scenes if you like action movies  like  The Matrix or  The Shooter or  stuff like that, this is a really good movie.   It's got some twists to it especially in the first one.  But   it's a, it's a  really good movie.  This guy Jason Bourne doesn't know his identity.   Because he was an ex CIA agent and he's, he's  trying to find it and in the process he   kills some people and  does this thing.  USA Today rates it as thrilling  and  there have been some other really good reviews about this movie. And   Matt Damon  great actor, won some academy awards so he's pretty famous.  And   I like this one  I think more than the first one,  and I'll probably like the third one even more.  So if you like action movies, this is a good movie.	2.708
This is Dustin with a video review for a DVD and today we're looking at Coach Carter.   This is an MTV production DVD and it's starring Samuel Jackson. As you can see there he's the little dude holding, well, kicking the basketball or whatever you wanna say.  Basically   he is a coach of a basketball team and there's all these kids that are like, troubled you know. They come from like, bad homes   bad families   bad friends.   Lots of drugs, gang things like that. You get the story.   Basically he teaches them that, you know, there's more to life than all these bad things and everything.   Overall  I didn't like this movie very much at all actually.   I would have to give this movie a two out of five. Very   I don't know, stereotypical  I I  feel.   I feel that you would just waste your time if you watch this movie, so I would recommend not doing it. Two out of five.	3.873
This is Dustin with a video review of A Cinderella Story, starring Hilary Duff, as you can see on this dudes back here.   That's basically the best part of this movie is that it does feature Hilary Duff  because she's pretty hot.   But other than that, I mean this movie is    {fart noise} not good at all.   It's It's  like  they try to make  the story of Cinderella,  the classic fairy tale,   into a modern day LA type story and basically, this girl, she  she works like manual labor and all this and stuff and  she has an email buddy and he ends up asking her to go to the dance with her. It ends up that this email buddy is like the coolest dude out there and stuff. So she starts freaking out  and basically you know, they get together they go to the dance. Aww it's all perfect and all that.   I would give this movie a two out of five. It's  completely a chick flick. I mean if you're a chick, maybe   a four out of five, maybe. But if you're a dude, don't waste your time.	4.69
Hey everybody this is Steven I'm here to review a movie.    This time I'm going to be reviewing of Eye of the Needle.    This is a good movie, it stars Donald Sutherland and Kate Neligen.    It's an MGM DVD,    It's a good company.  This is a great movie.   Definitely action-packed, it's rated R.    It's about an hour and fifty-one minutes and it was made in nineteen eighty-one.    It's a romantic, scary and extraordinary achievement.    It's definitely a movie worth watching.   I don't want to give away too many, too much of the plot but  if you've read the book I definitely recommend this because   it's a quality film.   So if you're looking for a good movie definitely try it, Eye of the Needle because it's worth it.    I'd give it four or five out of five stars because it's a good movie.    Again, Eye of the Needle, for MGM DVD.   Starring Donald Sutherland and Kate	2.708
Hi, my name's Anna and I want to review the movie Once.   Once was a surprisingly great movie.    When someone described it to me they just said it was an Irish musical which made me think it would be all like   show tunes and stuff like that, but actually it was really sweet, kind of,   I guess,   indie music you could say.    It was just really realistic movie. It was the kind of movie that you   kind of feel like you just watched  a chapter of someone's life rather than a fictional movie. And I found out that the two main characters are actually dating now, so I think that added to the onscreen chemistry that was so good.    The movie,  sorry the music in the movie was incredible.    the lead singer of the frames and    he was he was  awesome. I found out that the two main characters actually wrote their own songs, so that was really cool.    I would go see it   right away, I don't know how many theaters it's playing in,   it it  was only playing in one theater    where I live, but it was good, it only cost five fifty for a matinee.    Totally worth the money I spent, so as soon as you have a chance, go out and see Once and you won't regret it.	2.708
I just watched  this movie, Happily N'Ever After. I was looking very forward to seeing it when I had remembered seeing the previews for it.  I was very disappointed in it. I think it could have been  so much more. I mean there was a few funny parts and I expected more from you know, considering all the stars it has in it. It has Sarah Michelle Gellar, Freddy Prince Jr., Andy Dick, George Carlin and Sigourney Weaver just to name a few. So I guess I just expected a few more, a a  better movie from these  actors.  This is rated PG so you can watch this with your kids.  However, I started watching it with my kids and they got so bored they got up and left, went outside to play. So I was left watching this by myself, and I went ahead and watched it all the way through to the end so I could do this review and I was hoping that it would get better in the end.  It didn't.    Very Disappointing.  Not much else I can say about it.   Rent it if you must  I would. I'm glad I didn't pay money to go see this at the movies. I would've really been upset had I paid  you know, seven eight bucks a ticket for us to go see this.  So anyway, if you don't have anything better to do, then you might watch this movie. Otherwise I would say skip it and save your money.	5.802
Hello.   I am reviewing Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. It is the fifth  movie in the series  and   {noise}  it is it's  probably one of the darker   movies in the series, doesn't end on an happy note.  He's back!   Yeah and in this,   I was very disappointed with this film , I'm a pretty big Harry Potter fan   and I enjoyed the fourth movie pretty,  yeah I enjoyed the fourth movie,    but this movie,   I would have to give it ten fingers down.   Yeah  So, pretty much  this movie fails on all levels.  Emma Watson cannot act.  Rupert Grint who is  probably only one of the good actors in the series.   He  plays a lesser role.   The special effects aren't that great   like the scene where they are flying on broom sticks   towards  the order headquarters.  You can tell it was shot   from a flying vehicle over the water   and not as someone following the flyers.    If you haven't read the books, it will probably be really confusing since the director tried to   cram everything in there.   I thought the Umbridge actress was pretty good,   she was a bitch which is   what I wanted  but,  the movie,  it tried putting random scares for no reason and  the special effects were alright but with the budget this film had and  how high my expectations were, this film is  very horrible. I would not recommend it. I would recommend instead you read the book.   Bye.	5.972
Hi    I am Ratatouille , I am reviewing Ratatouille  Pixar's latest film.  It's Pixar so it's computer animation with  human voices. And this time.  So pretty much Pixar  takes something random like, fish  or automobiles or  children's toys and  gives them human personalities, emotions,  and problems. And  so and this time in Ratatouille it's rats.  And it's about this one rat that wants to be a chef.  And   he wants to be a chef because     unlike other rats,  he has a sense of smell.  So apparently he doesn't like eating garbage,  so he wants to eat delicious things.  So he goes to France  and in the end.  Oh well yeah you have to watch the movie, I can't really do, okay so.  Anyways let me talk about the movie.   I give this movie  two thumbs up.  It's Pixar so  you can expect a lot. I was except , I was expecting a lot and this movie delivered on in every way.  The animation is amazing, the rats are  fluffy and cute and  just realistic looking.  The  the movement.   There was a scene underwater where  I felt like I was being swept away on a rollercoaster ride.     This movie is really funny there are a lot of random jokes that  adults would appreciate and not just the kids   It had a little bit of a moral, no stealing.  Even though rats need to steal to live, but.  If you can get over that it's a good movie.  Good story,  very funny, very likeable.  Happy ending,  I would recommend it. Bye.	4.967
This is Chobits disc three, Darkness Descends.    This is the third disc in the three disc   Chobits collection and this one has   chapter nine through twelve.    Each of them have four chapters on a disc.    Hideki, beside himself with joy,   is going on a date with Yumi.    Basically   this is an anime movie.   If it's not your kind of thing, then   I didn't really like it, but I don't like anime.    I've also heard from people who do enjoy it, this is by far the worst of the three.  So  definitely, if you really like the first two,  maybe you should check this out. But  I've heard it's really not very good.   I definitely didn't enjoy it,  as somebody who's not into anime.  But if that's your thing,  then I guess you could try it out.   I would definitely say if you do think you'd be interested in this,  that you should rent it  before you buy it, because  personally I think it would be a waste of fifteen dollars.   Again it's  suggested for sixteen and up,  so it's not gonna be inappropriate just kind of boring.	2.944
Hi my name is Jordan and I would like to review Pirates of the Caribbean three, at world's end.      Frankly, I I've  seen the first two so I knew the kind of you know  wonderings that the characters  you say undertake but  after seeing the third I  was horribly disappointed.    It it  was so confusing about what was happening. Half the movie was not fighting was you know backstabbing and underhand dealings and you never know who was on who's team and what was going on.  Really not I think in order to see this movie, you would have to watch the first two  right beforehand to understand it properly  because, coming out of that theater after two and a half hours,  I still had on idea what was going on.   I don't know what the movie directors were thinking I guess they decided that by throwing as much fancy computer graphics as they could they would cover up the fact that there was absolutely no plot.     Really,    unless you're a die hard fan, I would not recommend this one.  You're really not missing out on anything.   And in fact, you know a lot of the character development was kinda   was a little bit angering such as  you know Keira Knightley's development. I am not going to give away the plot if you do want to see it but    but I was very disappointed.  Okay.  Thanks.	5.802
I'm doing a review for Evan Almighty which is a movie currently in theaters starring  Steve Carrell, Morgan Freeman and Lauren Graham.  And it's about a modern day   Noah's Ark story and as as  and as you can imagine there's if you try to put the Noah's Ark story in modern times,   there's gonna be some wacky hijinks that follow and obviously there are   as  Steve Carrell becomes   Noah both in physical appearance and in his  duty to   build a huge ark in the middle of a  populated American town, so.   Morgan Freeman plays God,  as he did in the Bruce Almighty movie.   I like Morgan Freeman a lot, I don't think these roles give him much to do but  it's good seeing him and he he  plays a pretty convincing God.    Wasn't a big of this movie.   I thought it  was a little too farcical,   the comedy wasn't really smart, so if you're not a big fan of    the first movie, the Bruce Almighty,  and you just saw this movie as a preview I would suggest holding off and waiting until it comes on DVD.	6.055
I'm doing a review for the documentary Sicko, currently out in theaters.  Made by the filmmaker  Michael Moore, a highly controversial filmmaker. He's known for such movies as Fahrenheit Nine-Eleven and Bowling for Columbine.   This movie has to do with   the American healthcare system being  in trouble,  not very efficient,  just in, just in  disarray really. And   the movie has its interesting points. He makes some interesting   presentations regarding the quality of healthcare you can get in America and it's compared to, let's say Canada, or Europe, or Cuba, or other countries like that. I don't want to give away some of the   dramatic points he makes, I'll let you judge for yourself when you go see it in theaters but   if the points he's making are true   then it's really powerful stuff, but you have to hope they're true. I mean sometimes,   you know, he hasn't been known for being totally impartial, so take it with a grain of sand, but judge it for yourself. I think it's worth going to see.	4.435
Hello,    Sarah here talking about Spider-Man Three, one of the first of several extensions of   trilogies or other series of the summer. And    basically   the beginning of the end of original entertainment. And    I think this movie was a perfect representation of that. It was  satisfying in the laziest way, it was    just  basically the minimum that you might  expect from an action movie.  The fight scenes were weak, the  characters were completely underdeveloped,   basically the story was all over the place and everything that was interesting about it was barely touched on at all and it just seemed  like they put almost no effort into making it because they knew  that because it was a trilogy and a successful series  that they didn't have to actually try to get people to go to the theaters.  And it did break the box office records.  And  I think that's pretty pathetic, I mean maybe it's just  trying, I mean  it says that more and more people are going to the movies and  less and less people actually care about what they're watching and taking in.  And   I say boycott Spider-Man Three because it's not worth your time or anybody else's.	6.403
I just saw Pirates of the Caribbean Three  At World's End and  I was a bit disappointed. I thought that movie was  terrible actually. It was probably the worst out of all three, and the second one wasn't that great either.   First of all it was way too long, two and a half hours.  It was just boring and there's too much story to it, not enough  action, like  I would get up and leave just cause it was so bad and  yeah. I did not like it at all.  Had some really good actors in it but    still  Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom and Kira Knightley don't really do it for me.   The action scenes in that movie stunk, the story of that movie was  pretty bad too.   Also the ending of that movie sucked too. Also like the second one, just kind of left you there like  , what happens?   So you definitely know they're going to make a fourth one  but  I don't like that kind of thing   and  I think Pirates of the Caribbean has gone on way too long and they should probably stop making it after this next movie  or just stop in the middle of making the next movie and  realize that their movies suck.  So, yeah, I give Pirates of the Caribbean Three a one because   that movie was just  terrible.	3.697
City of God.   My favorite foreign film. This one's from Brazil, all in Portuguese.   Takes place in the city of god, that's outside of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.    City of God's like somewhere not a lot people go, and not a lot of journalists venture out there. it's known for  high drugs,   like killings,  just anything that's against the law happens there.     But the story is about how a couple kids grew up   just them growing up starting with the small crimes, to being like the country's biggest drug dealers and like the battles along the way and  all the gangs that start. But the one kid that is a photographer and   he's like the first one to like get all these pictures of what's happening.   But I don't really want to give away too much because if I do I might ruin the whole movie. It's something that shouldn't be ruined because it's that great. So   if you want to see a very good foreign film, City of God. I rated this  four point eight because  best foreign film I've ever seen. Not romantic comedy,  not comedy. This is like  serious gun drug battles so  City of God.  Just buy it at Best Buy, don't even  don't even rent it from Netflix.  {noise}	6.055
What's up everyone, I have a movie review for you today.   I recently went and saw the movie  by   Disney Pixar  called Ratatouille.  And I absolutely loved it.   There's a picture of the movie poster.   I thought it was a really, really great movie.   I know it was made for kids but I thought there was a lot of   just entertaining parts, there's some adult humor,  and I would really just give it five stars out of five.   I was a little disappointed in Finding Nemo, because  my expectations were high,  and I figured that this would be the same way, but   I thought Ratatouille was absolutely fantastic.  And I would recommend it to all ages.  It keeps you entertained the whole time, it has a great storyline,   the animation is by Pixar so it was obviously amazing.  And I really just had a great time seeing it and did not regret paying the   high movie prices at the theaters, so.  You get a chance, I highly recommend  that you see  Ratatouille in theaters.	5.354
Teddy Bear's Picnic.  This movie is about   a sort of went, it's sort of behind the scenes,   it's like the stuff that's supposed to be, supposed to be  happening you know, behind closed curtains.    Basically when    you know,    it's sort of like the politics biggest hitters,  you know the economy fortune, fortune  five hundred   peeps up there on the, you know the richest in the world.   And they stop being businessmen, just take a break.   You know, chill have fun like guys, go fishing,    hire prostitutes,   whoops.   Yeah, so crazy stuff goes down. Just like what I just said. So basically it's these you know, these men, these these  business guys, you know taking a break from their normal lives and taking a week off just the boys.   Going out, and what kind of mayhem, what kind of chaos, what kind of excitement, what kind of crazy stories are they going to leave there with.   So   what happens on teddy bear's picnics stays in teddy bear's picnic. Hmm?	5.745
The movie's Disorganized Crime  and  It's pretty funny, it's a pretty ha ha title because you know it's not organized crime, it's disorganized. {laughs}   But basically this movie is   it's like a bunch of gangsters  and their attempt  to rob a bank, like most gangsters would in their lifetime.    And they have everything they need except for like brains and a plan and money or a boss or anything like that.  But they're still gonna try it because they're stupid.   But the one thing they do have going for them is that    these two cops right here in Disorganized Crime, are actually stupider than they are, not very smart.   So     let's just see I mean the whole movies you know, how does this unfold? Are the cops really that stupid? Are the gangsters stupider? Stupider than stupider? Are you stupider than me? So   essential questions in life will be answered in this movie.   So    you know, stick around for Disorganized Crime. It's definitely an action comedy close to rival others such as The Last Action Hero, much like that.    And it reminds me a lot of Mel Brooks movies and funny movies like       what are those baseball movies    Naked Gun, the Naked Gun, pretty much similar. So check it out, really funny. Disorganized.	5.0
This review is on the   The English movie, I'll Be There.    I wasn't too impressed.  This is, I didn't even watch the whole thing to be honest with you.   This is guy girl named guy named guy named  Craig Ferguson  Charlotte Church.   I've seen Craig Ferguson before,    but not not not ,  Charlotte Church.  It's about a girl who her dad was a rock star or is a rocks ,  was a rock star and   she wants to sing as her career, his old assistant comes to help her.  It's an English movie    Don't really get the humor in it.  Don't really know if it's a humorous movie or a serious movie,  I can't really tell.    This is the widescreen version.   It's rated PG-thirteen.    If I remember,   it was actually going to, I didn't watch the whole thing,   but it was going to be fairly long.      Not impressed. Would not going to give this one a very good rating      It's okay.  It's borderline okay, it's kind of bad, actually almost.   but anyway again this is the DVD,  excuse me version of I'll Be There and it's rated PG-thirteen  and I would not necessarily recommend this  unless you have nothing else to watch.	4.69
Hi. Summer here, and I was recently looking for a really great DVD for my kids to watch   and upon browsing all the DVDs I couldn't find any that weren't animated. So it made me think back to what I watched when I was a kid.   And what I found was a double feature of The Neverending Story and the Neverending Story Two. Now let me tell you, The Neverending Story is a fantastic movie that I must have watched a hundred times when I was a kid. This DVD retails for under ten dollars for two movies. So that's simply just a value in and of itself. Now of course the movie is old enough that there are no big name stars in it, but The Neverending Story I can tell you is a battle that a child has between reality and fantasy, and The Neverending Story Two is that continuing battle. Now this   movie series is epic for its time. The cinematography, the characters, the different  fantasy  actors and actresses that are brought to life are truly fantastic for kids and their imagination. So this movie  is a must buy for anybody who has a family. Go out, purchase The Neverending Story and the Neverending Story Two double feature. Five stars. Great movie.	6.683
Hey there. Summer here and if you're looking for a fantastic DVD at a value price that everyone in your family can watch, well why not try Pay It Forward, with Haley Joel Osment, Helen Hunt, and Kevin Spacey? This movie takes you through the journey of a child who learns life's lessons and it might just leave you crying in the end. Now I purchased this DVD for a little under ten dollars so it's a great value to add to your DVD collection. But, word of caution. The movie is PG thirteen for some mature thematic elements including substance abuse and recovery, some sexual situations, language, and brief violence. But  let me tell you for your older kids you can learn a lesson from this like none other. According to the movie it's a simple story line. Haley Joel Osment has a teacher, Kevin Spacey, and a mom, Helen Hunt. The teacher gives him a lesson. Let's change the world. And he does. The process of the movie takes you through how he changed the world and how it comes from his small town to change people's lives all the way across the country. This movie truly teaches you that one person can make a difference. So why not buy Pay It Forward, add it to your collection and teach your kids a life lesson that you can change the world?	6.683
So you're looking for a great movie that you can watch with your family, with your kids, with just about everyone. No bad language,  no people getting killed, no bad things. I found it. You don't have to look anymore. That's right. The movie is Tucker, with Jeff Bridges. This movie is the story of a man and his dream. His dream is to build the most fantastic car, the best car that will never need to be fixed. That has everything a family, a mother, a father, a consumer could want. And guess what? He does it. But in the process he also,  well, he really makes the big car companies mad. This movie is a fantastic tale of a man's journey from the beginning of his dream to the fruition of his dream. I purchased this DVD for right around five dollars so it's a great add to your DVD collection. I'm giving this movie five stars across the board. It is rated PG, but   that's only for a few little   sequences that may be inappropriate for kids so you'll have to make the judgement on this for yourself. After you watch it one time you're going to want to watch it a hundred times more. Tucker. Great DVD, great price, great value.	7.0
Alright. Donnie Darko. Starring  Jake Gyllenhaal,  it's got Patrick Swayze in it, and Drew Barrymore.  Those are the main actors in this one.  This film is consider an independent film by most people  because it was kind of kept underground, it wasn't done by a major production company.  It's rated R for  language, some drug use, and violence.    This movie is one of my absolute favorites. It's kind of hard to say what it's about but the main character  is Donnie Darko, obviously, played by Jake Gyllenhaal  and  he plays  a high school teenager who's kind of not a hundred percent up in the head.  He has this imaginary friend who keeps appearing,  and he keeps kind of going into these trances whenever he sees this friend and he has sort of an out of body, not really an out of body out of body  experience, but he becomes this different  person almost like he's got dual personalities. And but the thing is that's not just what the movie is  about. He gets very interested in time travel  throughout the movie and he starts really studying up on time travel and that  towards the end especially becomes a major part of the movie.  And he also meets this girl  who, who  he ends up going out with who also has a major influence  on the outcome of the plot. And  I'm trying not to tell you too much without ruining the ending, but basically this movie hits  all the good points of an excellent film. It's got a bit of action, a bit of romance, all that jazz.  I  had  I had a lot of fun watching it, it's got  very good acting in this film. The characters are all very unique and very well played out.  I would suggest you watch it. Donnie Darko. I would give this movie probably a four point six out of five stars.	4.69
Expotv.   You know, aside from the concert of  for Bangladesh    The Concert for George is  my other favorite concert  and this is a  a classic in its own right.  This is  two-thousand-two I believe. Yes, this is in the Royal Albert Hall in England.  And that was basically a tribute concert for  the late George Harrison who died in two-thousand-one. This is Eric Clapton getting a bunch of   George's old friends together and just a lot of other musicians and playing  George's songs and having a good time doing it. They recorded it. The recording quality, I think, is amazing for a live concert.   It's  better than the CD quality, it's just great.  It begins, it has two sections, it has an Indian music section and then the rock music section. The Indian music section is  performed by Anoushka Shankar which is Robby Shankar's daughter. And  she does some sitar playing then she actually conducts a  intermixed western orchestra and eastern Indian orchestra which makes for some interesting sounds.  The second half is just the band, Eric Clapton, Billy Preston, Joe Brown, Gary Brooker, Jeff Flint, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.  You know, all those type of guys just  playing George's songs and they got about twenty of those.  And it's great, it's a great  experience. It's a  quality DVD, great music,    great sound. It's got everything, five out of five stars, thumbs way up.	5.477
Hi  I will be reviewing the movie Hot Fuzz which is out  currently in theaters it is by the same makers of the  The culted classic  Shawn of the Dead it is basically   It's pretty much  a smart movie, that tries to spoof other movies  But not in the dramatic sense that  I would say Scary Movie does  Hot Fuzz  is more of like an intelligence spoof like  there's some subtle references to other movies it's   and the comedy level of this movie was like very very high it's about   It's starts off with you know with a big time British cop  travel around the department  they transfer him to  Italian Brim with the lowest crime rate  and he bring he cracks down on the crime in this city but, there is no crime to be cracked down on so  you know  the police officers at the the station where he's transferred are very laid back.   He's a hard hitting cop he follows everything by the book and everything and   He and he discovered some  very  strange things about this city and how it keeps  its   lowest crime rate in the all of England and  it's just  an extremely funny movie I think   I think it has to be one of the best movies out this year   It was a big hit over in Britain and it's going to be a big hit in the USA, I recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedies   but for the younger kids, I wouldn't bring the young kids to this type of movie I would save it for a date or you know go to the movies by yourself after a dinner it's a great movie to see, if you if you're  into that stuff.	6.683
There's Something About Mary.  With Cameron Diaz, and Ben Stiller, and Matt Dillon of course, but I had to read that on the movie title.  This is a pretty funny,  I would call it  I mean it's not a chick flick,  but it it's  pretty much almost a romantic comedy.  It's sort of brisking on    in between comedy and romance and chick flick and    suspense? There's a little bit of suspense in there, but not in the suspense that you're thinking of.  But in this  Ben Stiller just gives  one of his more notable beginning of his career performances   with Camerzon Diaz. There's a lot of bathroom humor in this movie if you're down with that, which I am. I think it's pretty funny.  More along the lines of    Anchorman and sort of like the generation X humor which is    it's more like, you know, kind of close to like Knocked Up kind of movies like that.    But if you hate seeing a lot of bad things happen to one person over and over and over and eventually winning out you don't want to watch this movie because   it's a real pain to watch. Cause like I empathize with characters in movies and Ben Stiller just gets like ripped apart in this movie and I hate watching that over and over, so  I dunno.    But you should check it out for yourself cause it's still a really funny movie. So  so There's Something About Mary. See it for yourself.	4.435
My old roommate back in college,  in an attempt to   share common and bond with me would sometimes give me, you know,   box sets of anime that he especially enjoyed and I've hung onto them over the years because I can't throw things away  and one of said animes,  you have to say it like an angry samurai ANIME,  is   Ranma One Half.  Ranma. You just, you just  had Anma One Half, now you have Ranma. And the plot of this delightful little anime  is that,  oh I watched this, it's just been a few years.   Whatever. Their jacket thing sucks. He's a dude   when he gets splashed with cold or hot water, I forget which one temperature of water, turns into a hot girl. Hijinks ensue. Also there's like seven-thousand love interests and the girl that he's obviously courting  in traditional Japanese style is a complete and utter  not a good person.  She ,  you know, blames him for things that aren't his fault and always catches him in compromising situations and I really think that Japanese   cartoons at least, I can't say about TV, but Japanese cartoons are like  ten, fifteen years behind    my own obviously superior country's TV.   Just because we stopped relying as much on the  old sitcom formula of girlfriend finds guy doing something that could look bad and of course they never talk it out and they always assume the worst and  oh man it drives me crazy. And this is like  four seasons or something of that, every episode  and it's just no good.  It has a really ridiculously catchy poppy bubblegum pop theme though.  So  I don't know.   Sometimes the classic anime can be kind of decent because they weren't so big yet, they couldn't afford to make crap I guess but   I would avoid Ranma One Half unless you are a hardcore Japanese cartoon fan.	4.83
Hi, this is Bob rival and today I'm reviewing Serenity   for the PSP  that's a UMD video for the PSP.   Serenity is the movie variation of the   series Firefly that aired on Fox  was unfortunately cancelled   while many people felt that it was  still in its prime.  He did end up making a full length feature film and it's now available on DVD and in this case UMD.   If you're familiar with the show at all it follows all your favorite characters.   Captain Mal and his crew of miscreants as they go about adventures.   In a sort of near future  sci-fi rendition of   a classic cowboy story.  It is the future, it is spaceships but it's not   aliens and laser guns it's more of a wild west sort of   set in the future.  Planets have been colonized, a lot of them come up real rustic because they don't have a lot of the  advantages that the core planets have, so   like I said there are, there are  train robberies and bandits and six shooters. And it's tons of fun it's all set in space.  If you're a fan of the series it's definitely worth checking out if you got a PSP  definitely worth checking out on UMD  after a while you forget you're watching it on the small screen. And  it, get a pair of headphones it will come to life for you on your PSP.   Serenity by Joss Whedon on UMD I would give it two thumbs up.  Definitely check it out, thanks.	5.0
Hi my name is Tommy and today, I'm going to be talking to you about Punch drunk love it has Adam Sandler, and Emily Watson in it.  Now if you've seen any Adam Sandler movie you'll kind of say hmm  it's kind of all the same, well this is the one exception that I found to that rule.   It's definitely not what you expect from Adam Sandler there's no big head jokes, Jewish marriages  or anything of that sort like he has in every other film.   It's definitely got a couple twists in it.  If you  decide to buy this movie definitely watch it more than once, or else you'll miss a lot of it.   Adam Sandler gives an amazing and unusual performance as Barry Egan, a socially impaired owner of a small mausoleum business who is dominated by seven sisters and is unlikely to find love, unless it finds him.  When a mysterious woman comes into his life his emotions go haywire fluctuating between uncontrollable rage, lust, and self doubt.  Punch Drunk Love leaves you  addled,  and little dizzy and overcome a pleasing, unplaceable sensation. A romantic comedy as wonderful as it is strange that expands the genre  to its absurdist outer limits and makes us believe  from the writer director of Boogie Nights  and Magnolia, Punch Drunk Love is a dark, lovely and unique film experience.  Again if you've seen all of his other films this is definitely not going to be like them  But it's an amazing, amazing movie I would definitely recommend it to anybody, and that's Punch Drunk Love I give it five out of five.	5.196
Hi, I'm Carolyn. Today I'm reviewing the DVD Dune. Dune is quite an interesting DVD. As it says on the front, A place beyond your dreams. A movie beyond your imagination. It's definitely way beyond my imagination. And the beginning started out really pretty good and then it just got kind of too crazy, with this weird music that was, like, super electric guitar or something, but it just got a little bit crazy. So it is like science fiction. It is rated PG-thirteen for language and  a little bit of  kissing in there.    Let's see. It is Frank Herbert, classic science fiction epic was made into a movie. The director is  if I can find it here for you,  David Lynch, who did The Elephant Man and Eraserhead. And basically,  it's a story about  this intergalactic warrior. So you're out in space. It starts off being narrated by one of the  space princesses or whatever.  and  Paul is the messianic rise to leadership.  So this guy named Paul, he's born of this woman who was only supposed to have daughters, but she has this son and he's supposed to, well, this other land that has this  the spice, and this spice is what everybody wants in this intergalactic  you know, in this  galaxy and this space  world. And so,  on this land, on this other planet where the spice is harvested, they know that  the messiah will come.  So it's got a little religious undertones in it. And then it just goes kind of kookie and just keeps going on and on, with cool  special effects and  powerful performances and images. So it's a little over the top for me.  It did win Best Supporting  Actress in nineteen eighty three and  it's a classic. So if you've never seen Dune {laughter} and you want an adventure {laughter}, then you could go out and get this movie.  This is my review of the DVD Dune.	2.646
Hi, today I'm reviewing the movie Live Free or Die Hard starring Bruce Willis.  This is another one of the Die Hard movies. It is very, it's got a lot of action in it. It's got great characters.  It's got a good plot line. You know,  you know Bruce Willis, whenever he's in a movie like that he's going to be cut, banged up, whatever.  It's it's  on the same lines as the other Die Hards. It's got great cinematography, it's got great sound, it's got even got great plot lines.   It's action packed.  It keeps you involved in the movie throughout the entire movie.  This is something that if you've seen the other Die Hards you're going to like, you want to see this one.    If you can't, you can't see it in the theaters you need, you need  and wait, even when it comes out on DVD it's worth renting.    So, if you like to see good movies, good action packed movies in the theaters   that keep you on the edge of you seat   and keep you involved in the  movie throughout the entire movie  than you need to go see this movie today. I give this movie two thumbs up.	6.351
Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl.   Now I saw number two,   I haven't seen number three yet,   but number one  according to my friends who have seen it,   and I usually share their opinions on movies, is the best movie out of the series.    It stars Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley,   and this guy who apparently is Geoffrey Rush.   He plays one of the evil pirates.   But it's a good movie,    it's kind of    it's it's it's  aimed at a younger audience,   because it has some like corny humor in it and whatnot.   It's only rated  P, oh it is rated PG-thirteen,   but that's because of the action adventure violence, it doesn't have profanity, it doesn't have nudity,   it's a very clean movie unless you're like, you know, under thirteen and are sensitive to violence.   So I would certainly recommend seeing this movie.    Whether or not you plan on seeing number two and number three,    watch it because it's just, it's the best start to  a trilogy,   and most trilogies I guess the first movie is the best. But this one is really really good and I would give it five out of five stars.	6.055
I have here Napoleon Dynamite.  For those of you who are not familiar with Napoleon Dynamite,   this is definitely something that is an acquired taste, you either absolutely love this movie or you hate it.   I happen to be one of the lovers of it.   This is where  John Heder   you know got his  starting role he has   since then starred in Blades of Glory,  School for Scoundrels so  this is where he kind of really   got his start.   Napoleon Dynamite is kind of really a  random movie. It's about  this character here Napoleon.   And his brother Kip, his older brother Kip they live in this   like really weird town, really old school it's just really, really random.  He meets  a friend Pedro at school who wants to run for like class president.  It's just   a really out there movie  not  very easy to explain to you to be honest with you. But definitely something  if you have not seen it  maybe you wanna check it out and see if you are  a fan of it  something maybe I would recommend you borrowing from a friend  or renting before you actually go out and purchase it. Being that  it's either a hit or miss.   With this movie but  lots of merchandise has been out for it  definitely a movie that  I'll watch  over and over again, I mean there's a lot of sayings that people    have picked up from this movie. But   it's, it's  rated PG-thirteen there's nothing really bad in it, there's,   it's for kids, kids can watch it, it's fine. And  definitely something I would recommend to you but I would suggest like I said    maybe picking it up for a short amount of time before committing  to  buying the entire thing before   purchasing it so  hope you like it.	3.742
My review today is  the movie Surf's Up.  The animated  movie about  surfing penguins.    This movie starts out as a  very there's a very young penguin, he's wanting to break free from  where his family is.  He wants to go out and  see the world  and do some surfing.  Along the way,  before he before he  leaves town, this   surf guy   comes into his town   and gives him a necklace.   Basically getting him started into the surfing world.   he he  in turn wants to go out and   surf.  And be a big surfing star.  So he,  I don't exactly know what,  where exactly he goes, but he  runs across this   this big surfer guy  that's supposedly  dies, and  he learns to surf,  surfs really well,  wins a competition.  And  everything turns out okay in the movie.  I'm not real keen on the movie, I would give it  a two star rating.	2.708
This review is for a film currently in theaters called Spider-Man three.   Hugely popular film.   Big giant movie blockbuster trilogy.    So this is where I stand with the Spider-Man movies. Actually I didn't like the first one. I thought it was kind of boring and hokey.   Really enjoyed the second one a lot. I thought it was more mature. I thought it was deeper and had more of a message.   I really liked Doc Ock   He was a great villain and I really enjoyed Spider-Man two and actually,   it made up for Spider-Man one and I really couldn't wait for the third one to come out.  And so I go see Spider-Man three and once again I'm sorely disappointed.   It's hokey,  it's shallow,  it's,  it's not at all what you'd expect. Especially since  they introduced Venom in it which had so many possibilities for it to be   you know, another dark film, another more mature film.  But   Topher Grace from That seventies Show actually plays Venom, which I thought was a stupid choice.   He makes a really terrible Venom.   And  they turn the movie just into just basically a big joke.    You don't care at all for the characters, you don't care at all for the story line. It's really boring and   I don't know, like I've forgotten most of the things in the film just because I didn't care about it that much.   So I was sorely disappointed and    I probably won't be go see the fourth Spider-Man because they completely lost me now.   So yeah that Spider-Man three, pretty terrible,   sorry.	5.416
Hello, this review is for Star Wars The Empire Strikes back. This is my favorite of all the Star Wars movies.  It's really   dark kind of movie    everything kind of starts going bad for the rebels, they get driven off their ice planet in the beginning. There's a giant battle right starting off,  these giant walkers, the AT-ATs come, and they attack everything, and they blow up their base and the rebels have to run.   And then Luke Skywalker goes to be trained as a jedi  and he meets Yoda, and Yoda teaches him all about the force and how to use it and how to become a true jedi, and not succumb to the power of the dark side.   And then in the end he's forced to confront Vader. Vader traps his friends and and  lures him into a trap  to try and take him to the emperor.   Really intense movie, really cool. Billy Dee Williams comes and    makes his appearance as Lando Calrissian, of course Carrie Fisher is in it.   Frank Oz does the voice of Yoda, who Frank Oz has of course done Muppet movies and voices for all sorts of people. It was really great. And Harrison Ford returns as Han Solo, and this is just  a really awesome movie. Check it out if you haven't seen it. It's definitely the best Star Wars movie ever made.	6.055
This movie review is gonna be for Lilo and Stitch, which is an absolutely great movie.  Now I've mentioned before I love Disney movies, I love all things Disney.  And this is one of my favorite Disney movies  because it incorporates two of my favorite things, Disney and Elvis.   Lilo, the little girl in the movie  lives in Hawaii and she is an Elvis fan.  But   she's also having family problems and she's feeling separated from her family because she's become an orphan and she's living with her older sister.  And   becomes in tune with an alien, Stitch,  and it's such a sweet story.  And it brings to notion the idea family, what makes a family,  and teaches you that you know, your traditional family isn't always what you think it is.  And that what really makes a family is people loving each other and caring about each other.  It's a great movie, it's really sweet, children will love it, adults will love it, everyone will love it.   Great soundtrack of course, it has Elvis songs in it as well.   I highly recommend it, love it, if you haven't seen it, it's definitely one that you need to rent.   I would actually recommend, you know, making sure that you buy it because you'll want to see it over and over again once you see it for the first time. So I highly recommend it, thanks.	6.683
I'm holding The Magic of Ordinary Days. This was a Hallmark movie that originally aired on the CBS network.  And you can find this movie at any Hallmark store nation wide or at Hallmark dot com. The Magic of Ordinary Days was based off the novel by Anne Howard Krill and it stars Keri Russell of WB's Felicity and also Skeet Ulrich who stars on CBS's Jericho.   This film also features  Mare Winningham, who starred in many Hallmark movies.   This movie tells the story of Olivia, who finds herself in bad circumstances and she's sent away to marry a man named Ray.   She doesn't like Ray at first and she just kind of tries to stay away from him as much as she can.  But throughout the movie she  falls in love with him and  you know, finds that he is the  man of her dreams and she decides to stay stay  in the small town where she's at, though through most of the movie she was determined to leave.   This movie was purchased for twenty dollars. I love it. I think it's a great movie by Hallmark. I was very  very happy when I first watched it. I just thought it was one of the greatest Hallmark feature films that was made.  So I give it five stars and again you can purchase this at Hallmark.	4.967
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix  yes Harry Potter's back and I think he's forty seven in this one no no he's not that old but  he's starting to look old in the movies they're all starting to look all grown up, and   I'll admit it that I'm I'm  a dork and I enjoy the Harry Potter movies not saying everybody that enjoys Harry Potter movie is necessarily a dork, but   I'm an older gentleman and I enjoy the kid movies but  it's a very good movie   I mean the the the  movies in general are very good they the first one was really good the second one was still pretty good, and they just went on downhill from down there, this one wasn't very good I mean I didn't think it was that good   Harry's back in school yet again and I think this is his fifth year, and   this time new people are taking over Hogwart the school, see I told you I'm a dork I know the names of the school, and  they're trying to discredit Harry saying that Lord  the the  bad guys coming back I don't know his name Valdemort, Valdemont  I know it begins with a V I know that much  but they're trying to discredit him and   to me it just seems   I don't know maybe i'm growing up whenever the first one came out I was a little younger than I am now but  I didn't enjoy this one  and I'm sure kids will enjoy it, I I  mean there was a lot of magic and the acting in it was really good, and  the scenes were really good the  the magic scenes looked awesome, but  I just didn't enjoy it. It was okay for me but it wasn't great.	4.69
Hi today I'm gonna review this DVD Ten Items or Less.   This is a short documentary film that stars Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega.    It was really very strange movie  I guess it's from the documentary style. It deals with  the Latino community and this underprivileged girl who works at a grocery store  and Morgan Freeman is this older, out of work movie star who  sort of takes up to her and  tries to help her and build her self esteem.  The character {cough}  the characters  you really  learn to enjoy their   their bond that they build between each other.  But as far as the movie   it was just not a   very exciting movie, I couldn't really figure out the plot to the story.  I mean it had a plot but it was sort of like what's the point.   They did a good job with the acting but the storyline just didn't hold up as far as I was concerned it was just too much just normal everyday life.  {cough}  This particular one is rated R and it's only eighty-two minutes long.  It's English with  Spanish subtitles,  and   I probably wouldn't really recommend it I mean if you have it it's fun to watch but I probably wouldn't recommend buying it. I'd probably give it two and a half stars and    that's about it for this one.   Thanks.	3.367
Hello I'm Matthew and I'm here to tell you about this DVD Movie  {cough} this is easy money starring Rodney Dangerfield   he is a comedian actor  that did comedy back in the eighties and nineties and recently passed away a few years ago.  And this   movie is about him  trying to get money the easiest way possible   the run time is an hour and thirty-five-minutes so it's not too long and   it was made in nineteen-eighty-three  very early eighties films   some people think that Rodney Dangerfield is a comedic genius   but I never personally never liked him   this is strictly just my personal opinion, but I always found him annoying and not funny and   I never really really liked him at all, but I  we do have somebody in my family that did, and I bought this as a birthday present  for them and they  they like Rodney Dangerfield and they really like this DVD   the the  clarity is great  the sound is great  on this DVD, and they've been really pleased with it, and  as far as the transfers and stuff I've been pleased with it, but again I don't like  the movie itself.	2.38
Hi, today I'm gonna  review the movie I recently saw in theater, it's Live Free or Die Hard.  This is an action adventure thriller that was just, I mean there's no way you could be bored in this movie. I thought it was an excellent movie.  It stars Bruce Willis, he plays the part of John McClane. This is the fourth in a series of shows. I had never seen the other shows, but I thoroughly enjoyed this one. It's   rated PG-thirteen, it's a little over two hours long and it's basically about this old-fashioned cop  who  is used to doing things the hard way or the normal way  as opposed to the younger generation who thinks everything has to be done through computers. But there's a young guy played by Justin Long, and if you can't recognize who he is, he's in the   Mac and  PC commercial. He plays the Mac and I kept thinking the whole movie you know, who is this guy. But that's who it is.  He plays a young computer hacker who accidentally helps the  wrong people get some   information and helps them  try to destroy the US's  whole computer system, everything going and   John McClane comes to help  you know, fix this problem and they work together and they solve it.  It's a very high action movie and you know you could  go along with most of it. They had some helicopters and some freeway scenes that were just, you know, a little bit outrageous at one point. But   I mean as long as you're not expecting it to be totally realistic and you know you're  in an action movie that's fine.  It was an excellent movie, I'd give it   five stars because I was not bored one minute. I was on the edge of my seat and I thought it was very entertaining.  Thank you.	2.708
I told a lot of people about it and    I tried not to tell them the story or anything but all I could   say about it was   go get it, you know. Go see it, it's a great movie. It's fun, it's wonderful, you know?  You don't have to know French to like it. You don't have to  like cartoons to like it. You You  just go see it and you'll enjoy it for what it is like I did.  And I never saw, I haven't seen cartoons in years and   this one was just so good.   What am I talking about? Of course I'm talking about the movie Ratatouille.  So   I don't know what else to say about it. Just go see it, you'll like it. I,  you know I haven't watched cartoons in so long and  this one was great.  It's better than anything else I've seen lately.   Five stars from me, two thumbs up. Just  go see it, you'll like it if you haven't seen it already. If you have  try to see it again.	5.099
I'm holding the hilarious movie The Princess Diaries, starring Anne Hathaway and Julie Andrews.  This film tells the story of  Mia Thermopolis who is a gawky and odd teenager who lives in San Francisco yet finds out that she is princess to the throne of Genovia,  a European country.   Julie Andrews stars as the queen and who comes and tells Mia the secret that was kept from her her  whole life.  This movie was purchased at Walmart  for fifteen dollars but you can also find it at Target or online at DisneyDVD dot com.   This is  a great movie. I think it's great for girls and I think it's great for teenagers.   My brothers even watch this. So if my brothers watch it, you know it's a good movie.   It is rated G and I give it five stars because I  just think it's wonderful. So, highly recommend it. Five stars.	4.967
Hey expo.  I have a movie review for you today, and it's not very good.  The movie that I'm reviewing is Cashback.    Not much to say about this movie, it had had  a pretty weak story line I think.  Characters were a little bit   shaky. I don't know, it it  didn't seem like it, movie itself didn't seem like it was together too well.   I don't know, it was  a lot of just unnecessary things that just made it kind of played out and annoying.   I wouldn't pay to see it again.   Really wasn't that great. Not family movie  as you might know it's rated R, so obviously it's probably not a family movie.   But even if you're by yourself or with some friends or with anybody you probably still won't like it.  It's not, I don't like it. It's not that good.  But  you might like it, I didn't.   One out of five maybe. Yeah, one out of five.  So   Cashback not too great, so  go see it for yourself and see what you think  but I'm going to give it one out of five. So  there you have it.  One out of five.	4.435
Movie review, I Know Who Killed Me.   Nah, not very good. One out of five at very most.  But it's a Lindsay Lohan movie, so  I don't know.  I didn't like it. It was  kind of   more funny to me than it was scary. I kind of took the whole thing as a joke.  But  it's definitely in the vein of, like, I don't know, I'd I'd  say it's pretty similar, in some aspects, to a movie like   maybe even, maybe Saw. It's almost ,  I don't know, it's almost too similar, to the point of where you kind of know what's going to happen,  kind of all all  those kind of movies kind of blend together.  But, I mean, if you're going to watch a movie like that, go see Saw again or something, because this movie is really not good at all. Seriously. One out of five.  So if you want to see it, you can do it. But I wouldn't. So  I Know Who Killed Me, one out of five. I'm sorry.	3.786
HI, I'm here to review  American Wedding DVD.   This is the  third movie in the  American Pie series.  It's about  about Jason Biggs character  Jim. He   he decides to marry this girl  Michelle who was in the    the  very first movie  and   movie's definitely not as good as the  first one.   Second one wasn't that great either. This one also doesn't really make the cut.   It's just a lot of  crude crude humor.   I mean like I said, it's not a good movie.  I definitely wouldn't suggest it for anyone.   I don't know, I didn't really like it that much.   I mean it does have it's  a few funny points,   but they're scattered few and far between. So I mean I definitely wouldn't suggest this. It's definitely not a kids movie. Like, if you're gonna, even even  if you are gonna watch it , definitely don't watch it around kids because  they're very impressionable, you know?   But , like I said, I wouldn't suggest watching  American Wedding.	5.066
Hi, I'm here to review  Blade two, starring Wesley Snipes.   This is about a guy. He's a    werewolf hunter and he's a half vampire  and this is the  second movie in the  trilogy, the Blade trilogy, starring Wesley Snipes.   They also made this into a  TV show I believe.   This movie was  definitely not as goo as the first.   The first one had better story line   you know, better plot, better action, better dialogue.   But you know this one still has a lot of  a lot of good like action scenes, a lot of  kung-fu action.  Wesley Snipes is a   plays plays  the good role of a   of a  vampire hunter and     like I said   this is a alright movie. It's very gory.   Wouldn't say this is for the kids, it's definitely   I think it's rated R.   Well yeah, I mean if you like action like lots of lots of  blood and everything then I mean I would suggest going to get this this  DVD, Blade two.	3.0
I'll be reviewing the DVD version of Fantastic Four.   I was really disappointed with this movie you know. I wasn't I'm not a huge fan of Fantastic Four. My limited experience with comics to begin with but this just, was just kind of a   an  movie, you know. It's just kind of the big, super slick you know, action blockbuster that's you know, a lot of lot of  you know, colors, a lot of style but not really much substance behind it.   You know Michael Chiklis does a pretty good job but he's really the only  you know decent actor.  You know, the people the people  who get this you know, Jessica Alba's a good actress too but   he just you know, gives a pretty decent performance or worthwhile performance you know, a bunch.   You know, if you don't know what it's about   you know it's a team of scientists that go up into space to explore this kind of radiation field that's going by earth and you know it ends up  you know destroying their station and when they get back they all develop super powers you know. Four of em become the Fantastic Four and you know the fifth one   becomes you know the evil   the evil   the evil villain you know that they have to fight and save the world against.   You know like I said, it's it's  an alright movie. It's it's  a popcorn flick you know definitely. It's not even, unfortunately it's not even that great of a popcorn flick but you know, if you like this kind of movie you know, you probably wanna pick it up.   Special features is not so bad  you know. It's got a commentary from some of the actors and the director.   It's got a video diary from the filming, behind the scenes   you know some deleted scenes, a making of documentary. It's your usual bunch. I mean it's not that bad as far as that goes. But   you know it might be worth checking out,   you know if you like this kind of thing. But you know like I said it is honestly pretty forgettable in my opinion and   it's probably not worth more than a rental.	4.69
Hi, this is Dave and this is my review of The Matrix Revolutions. This is the third chapter, third and final chapter, in the Matrix trilogy  and I would say by far my least favorite of the three.   The first movie, I thought was really good. I enjoyed it.  it was very original. The second movie, not so much.  It still had some redeeming qualities like I did enjoy the action sequences quite a bit. But story wise it was a big disappointment over the first one.  And Matrix Revolutions, the third one, really gets even worse.   The action sequences I thought were  didn't even hold up. They were completely unbelievable and over the top and just not really that fun to watch.   The story got even worse I thought. It just  I don't really know where they were going with it.   But I would say if you've seen the first two movies already you might as well give it a watch just to finish up the trilogy and be done with it. But otherwise   I really think you could pass on this and  not be missing anything.   So, that's my advice.	4.69
This another DVD review.  This is my favorite movie so far this year, it just came out on DVD.  It's actually from two-thousand-four in Japan but it came out this year in the states.   It's The Taste of Tea.   It's just a really great  Japanese movie. It's about this family,  kind of a quirky family, who lives up in  rural  Japan, kind of north of Tokyo.   It's really long, and it's really, really, really, really beautiful. It's just  it it's  really, it's just a pretty movie and it has, it's a really good story. It's really really, really simple.  Great characters. It's got everything going for it.   Not rated I don't think, but yeah, it's really long. It's two  two and a half hours long I think, maybe.   Yeah. Comes in a white case. I don't know if that matters but I think it kind of looks nice  as far as packaging goes.  The transfer's good.  It's just an all-around good package.  If you haven't seen this movie yet definitely rent it, and if you love it you should buy it just to get more movies like this out here.   Yeah, definitely check out Taste of Tea. It's a really, really good movie.  Thanks.	4.967
{noise}  Hi, I'm here to review the  House Party DVD.    I didn't really like this movie.   It's a old  old-school movie.   It's about  this guy, Kid, he   he's played by Christopher Reid.  {noise}   He's basically a  a nerdy kid, comes to   comes to live in this in a rough neighborhood and  he's trying to learn the ropes, trying to be cool.  And  then he meets this guy, Play. And they become Kid and Play. And they   you know, try try  to make it up in the world. And they   try to throw a big house party, like have lots of fun and everything. And there's some people who  who are trying, you know, like spoil their fun and everything. Of course, his father is over protective.  Trying not to, trying to get  him focused on school and everything. And   you know, it wasn't that that  funny of a movie. But ,  like I said, I didn't really like it. Of course, it's a old movie, so that, that  could be it also. So, I mean,   all in all I wouldn't suggest getting, getting  this DVD. It's definitely not worth the money. You might want to catch it on HBO sometime.  {noise}	3.873
Hi, I'm here to review this movie   Jeepers Creepers two on DVD. This is the   special edition DVD.   This is the  second movie.   There was Jeepers Creepers one,  and   I mean I didn't like this movie.  I'm not a really big fan of horror movies.  It was about this  high school team. They   they get stranded on a   their bus breaks down and then   they're trying to survive this  this maniacal killer who's like killing them off one by one and    you know he's he's  selecting who he wants to kill and everything and they're trying to stick together. They're just trying to survive   I mean like anyone would do. They're definitely just trying to survive.   It's very gory.   So all the killings are really gruesome and   it was really gross.   Didn't really like this movie, just because of all the blood and all of the   all the gross, like, sick killing scenes. I mean if you're into that kind of stuff then I mean I would suggest it. But as it is, I didn't like this this  movie Jeepers Creepers two.	3.697
Hi, this is gonna be a review of the movie of I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry  and this is one of those movie when I saw the trailer,  I was all happy seeing to see that movie because it looks so hilarious in the trailer.  Well, unfortunately all the funny parts were apparently in the trailer   and I say that only because there were other funny parts in the movie but it was all those like obvious funny parts.   It was the type of humor that would appeal to an eight year old boy but that's what I should expect from an Adam Sandler comedy.   There were too many obvios jokes and I felt there was a lot of stereotypes.   I felt it went from a lot of stereotypes to a lot of  trying to force an after school special kind of movie on this   and   it just felt too unbelievable from going from stereotypes to trying to send a message so   it, there were some funny jokes in there. I just felt like all the jokes were already used in the trailers so that was a little disappointing to me.  It was a funny movie.   It wasn't as funny as I had hoped it would be.   It's one of those movie that you should definitely, you would be better off when it come out in DVD though it definitely wasn't worth going to see it at the movie theater.  I was just happen, I was just out with some friends and it was the type of movie that a group of friends would go together to see so, you know, it's definitely more of a DVD movie though but, thanks!	4.041
Hi this is Dave and today I'm talking about the Star Wars Trilogy.  This is the classic original trilogy of Star Wars and  and what do you say about Star Wars? They're  classic, incredible movies everyone should see, everyone should own.   these movies made a huge impact when they came out, obviously. They changed movie making forever.  Really groundbreaking.  They hold up today incredibly well. I think just about everyone still enjoys these movies.   they're just as fun as they were when they first came out and  I just can't recommend them enough.   this set comes with all three movies.  Episode Four A New Hope, Episode Five The Empire Strikes Back, and Episode Six the Return of the Jedi.   it also includes a fourth bonus disc   featuring all kinds of special features, documentaries, that kind of thing. So it's a really great set of one of the all time best trilogies in movies.  So I can't recommend it enough. I think everyone should have this in their collection.  It's the Star Wars Trilogy by George Lucas.	5.477
I'm gonna do a review on The  Best Little Whore House in Texas.  Don't ask me why I got this, but I thought it would be   fun because it has a character that plays Gomer Pyle in it, and Burt Reynolds, Dolly Parton, and I thought it would be a good movie. Don't get me wrong, it it it  has it's moments,  but it's an older movie.   I'm not sure when it was even made.   It says a release date.  Anyways,  I don't know   Pretty much it's it's  about this cop,  and there's this whore house and  they want to get it shut down and  the cop is  sleeping with the owner of the whore house and  you know, she wants him to be on her side and he,  it it's  an it's a weird movie and  yeah it has funny moments and stuff but it just  it just  doesn't keep me involved throughout the movie because I I just know that I  it's just  weird and  I'll probably won't watch this again  and I can't recommend someone watch this because it's just,  maybe for the   someone that's older than me that has seen it in the past or watched  shows like that in the past. They they  might enjoy it but  I, no, I didn't like it. Sorry.	3.416
Hi, I'm Bruce and today   I'm reviewing the DVD  widescreen edition of Premonition,   starring Sandra Bullock and Julian McMahon, and here's a closer look at it. I don't have the box for it because I rented it   at  Red Box, one of their kiosks.  And this is a psychological thriller. It's rated PG-thirteen,   and again starring Sandra Bullock and Julian McMahon and the   movie is about a woman who's forced to perpetually relive a terrible week in her life   where her husband is killed in a car crash.   {clears throat} And so we keep seeing a lot of same events over and over again.   What motivated me to  check out this movie was my wife,   really likes Sandra Bullock, so I got it primarily for her.  Unfortunately, I cannot recommend it. It was   rather disappointing.   and   It was very long. It was two hours and twenty minutes.   But it, and that's a long movie to me. But it felt   at least like three hours and the fact that they kept rewinding the story where she keeps reliving the same week over and over,  it felt extremely long   and   it just really went on a long time. So   I do not recommend this movie,  and that's my review of Premonition, now out on DVD.	3.464
 This is The Matrix Revolutions   the third installment in the Wachowski brothers matrix trilogy,  and definitely the worst.   I would give it probably two stars out of five.   I only bought this movie to complete the series.    It goes way too heavy on the Jesus references.   There's  just Neo in there, trying to save the world again and stuff and  just way too heavy on the Jesus references, I hated that.  And what made the first two movies great was like, the kung fu and hand to hand action.  And in this movie, it's all done with machines,  and it's just not nearly as cool it it  gets rather stupid. And   I I  just didn't get why they didn't stop after the second one. It   like the agents once again are multiplying, big surprise, and  {sigh} it's just all these machines going on and   just not the human emotion that were, that was in the first two.  And it just  don't do it with this movie at all.	3.786
Hi, this is my review of the movie The Chronicles of Riddick.   This movie I really bought just on a whim. I had seen the original movie starring Riddick   which is Pitch Black and I really enjoyed that movie so when this came out it looked like just a  big epic movie featuring   the same characters. So I figured it'd probably be pretty good so I picked it up.   Visually, it's really   pretty incredible movie but the story was kind of a let down. It's kind of just an instantly forgettable action movie.   I wasn't that impressed with it and I probably would not have bought it if I had seen it before I picked it up.   So I really can't recommend it although I did enjoy the previous movie, Pitch Black, which you might wanna check out.   Yeah, so I would say for the most part, you can skip this. But    if you do wanna check it out, just keep in mind that    the original was rated R I believe and this is an unrated version which   would definitely be inappropriate for children.   So this is The Chronicles of Riddick.	5.354
Hello, my name is Emma and today I'm going to review this DVD that I got.  It is the Blair Witch Project Two, Book of Shadows,  and  Blair Witch Project One, I know a lot of people didn't really like it, but I thought it was pretty good. It scared me a little bit, which is rare with a scary movie.  But this movie has absolutely nothing to do with The Blair Witch Project One.  You know, none of the same actors, hardly even the same plot, and a lot of really, really random weird stuff that makes absolutely no sense like,  you know, I wouldn't even be so angry about it if they had called it something different because it's clearly not The Blair Witch Project. I don't even think it was directed by the same person.  I got this DVD at  Best Buy for about  twelve dollars I think.  You know, I hadn't seen the movie yet. I like The Blair Witch Project, thought I'd like this too, but I didn't.  It was awful. I would not recommend buying it. It's really quite a ripoff if you do, because you're not gonna like it.	5.745
This is a review for Black Sheep, which came out this year in New Zealand.   I only watch this movie online but I really thought this plot was kind of   was very  not well thought out.   It was basically about   It was basically about   a man named Henry Oldfield  and he returns home to his brother Angus Oldfield Oldfield, who is doing giant experiments on sheep.   Henry Old Oldfield  was coming back from a psychiatric institute which  was treating him because of his fear of sheeps. And   he came back to Angus and he found out that Angus had  released a genetically engineered sheep that turned them into that turned the sheep into blood thirsty sheep.  Basically it was just Henry's  nightmare  came to life. Overall,   it was just basically this movie was basically about how Henry Angus had to avoid these deadly sheep which   this one sheep turned more thousands into blood thirsty sheeps. So basically they had to find a way to save New Zealand and avoid these sheep.   Personally I thought this movie, the plot was kind of lacking and it wasn't very fulfilling in my eyes.  So, I wouldn't really recommend this movie to most people, however if you  want to or you're just like a movie fanatic like myself  you can just go check it out, it might be a little bit interesting for yourself.	2.708
The Simpsons Movie. This ,  this movie is starring Latoya and Michael. Na, I'm kidding. It's a cartoon of course, everybody knows the Simpsons. And   the gist of the movie is   the lake gets polluted   the government puts a bubble over the town and   hilarity ensues I guess.  It wasn't,  I mean there were, it it  definitely felt different than an I love the Simpsons, but the movie felt different than the show.  I don't know, it wasn't as funny. I understand they had to stretch out the comedy. It was only like an hour and seventeen minutes, so what is that, three shows? Barely? Well around three shows so   it the the  comedy seemed stretched to me and   I would not take kids to see this movie. I wouldn't myself   it shows nakedness which, I mean, in a cartoon I don't want to see naked cartoons and it it not just the butt either . It shows nakedness.  Homer flips some people off which, and  Marge cusses at the end and not a small cuss word, I consider it a pretty big cuss word. Not, not  the big cuss word but but pretty close. And so I thought the movie was okay, I definitely probably going in thought it was going to be better than it was. It was okay.  But I would not take kids to it for those three simple facts.  Cartoon nudity, Homer flipping people off, Marge cussing.  So I I  say  I don't even know if like thirteen, fourteen might be a little too young, I don't know.  But for me I I  wouldn't, I don't maybe I'd take a thirteen year old so maybe PG thirteen but   it was an okay movie just don't take the little kids to it.	5.477
Hi.  I'm going to be telling you about a movie I saw over the weekend.  I watched it at the dollar fifty theater and the movie is called Hot Fuzz. And it's by the same guys who did Shawn of the Dead so you'll probably see some familiar actors if you've seen that movie.   First off if you have seen Shawn of the Dead I think you'll really like Hot Fuzz.   I actually saw Shawn of the Dead, I didn't really like it,  but I thought Hot Fuzz was great.  So the movie is about   well you've probably seen the previews. It's about  these two cops   who are in this really small town and  murders start happening, and  there's lots of zany antics.    But I thought it was a great movie, it's a British movie so the style of comedy is   a little more up tempo than typical American comedies  but it's also really watchable.   There's a really good story line that goes along with it and  by the end of the movie instead of slowing down,  it really picked up.  So they really followed through til the end with the movie which I thought was great.   So I definitely recommend it to anybody who's in the mood for comedy because  I thought it was an all around great movie, so definitely go check it out.	6.055
Hello. I'm Brianna and I'm here to talk about Finding Nemo, a Walt Disney Presentation and also Pixar Animation. Of course it's an animated movie so  but it's not just for kids as I thought until I watched it and   any adult would like it.  It's about a clownfish named Marlin who goes on a adventure to find his son which was taken by scuba divers, and he meets his, one of his best friends now, Dora, after his  wife I guess  died from a fish. And he meets sharks, jellyfish.  The sharks happen to be vegetarian so they got lucky {laugh}. And sea turtles and  all seagulls and stuff. And they find, they find  him at the end, but it's a very fun, adventurous journey in the end. I guess a lot of parents would  relate to it if they found out that their kid was taken from them.  So I guess it's  it's kind of meaningful, but it's still one of my best, one of my favorite movies and .  So I would I suggest to anybody, not just kids, but I would buy it for your kids and watch it with them cause you'll find out that you soon like it and  so I would guess  go buy it. Thanks.	3.0
Hey Expo TV, I'm Dia, and   like anybody else who ever lived, I will always make fun of Anne Rice because, I like like  I've totally read enough of her books to make fun of her, so I'm not I'm not  going in blind and just you know following the crowd and being like oh ho ho, Anne Rice is crazy. No she actually is and I've read her books. So  but  since I have read her books, I can tell you that the Queen of the Damned was one of the more interesting ones. You know, I find I find  a lot of her stuff to be extremely as I said crazy.  Not necessarily in a bad way but the Queen of the Damned was a awesome awesome book. Like it had has  so many subplots and they all tied together just incredibly.  and   unfortunately this movie doesn't really do that. This movie is   cracky crack on top of crack. It's crazy  and I'm not saying it doesn't have it's hilarity value but unfortunately this is not really a good movie. That said   also unfortunately this was Aaliyah's last movie before she passed and   even though it's completely cracky and crazy and so forth, it's worth the watch if only because Aaliyah and Stuart Townsend are so attractive. Like you watch it and you your  eyes are just boggled. They're like I cannot comprehend all of this pretty. Look at that.  Yeah, yeah I know.  Anyhow,   probably not, I mean, unless you're a big fan of someone who's in this movie, maybe not something that you're gonna want to own in your collection.  But you know since it's gonna be cheap guys honestly. It's not gonna be something expensive.   You should pick it up and give it a watch every  like whenever you've got some time because it's it's  cracky basically.	6.683
Hey guys, my name is Emma and I'm here to talk to you about a movie I saw recently,  Spider Man Three.   I gotta say I've seen the other two Spider Man movies and I wasn't really that impressed, you know. They're pretty entertaining I guess and I'm a fan of  Kirsten Dunst so I always like to watch movies that she's in but  I didn't have high expectations for Spider Man Three because I didn't really like the first two, but it certainly did not exceed my incredibly low expectations.  You know, it was probably worse than I thought it would be, actually.  Granted I only paid two dollars to see it,  there's a really cheap movie theater where I live that I can go see movies that have come out  recently for pretty cheap but  two dollars didn't even really seem like a bargain considering that movie, you know? Just really cheesy   the graphics and stuff were just kind of annoying, like the CGI stuff. I don't know, I'm not really into that, and  the action in it was really not that exciting.  The acting also horrible, you know, I realize it's based on a comic book and that's kind of the style that they're in, you know, kind of over the top, kind of cheesy, but  I don't know. I feel like there's a lot of movies that have come out recently based on comic books that are way better than the Spider Man ones and it's just kind of a disappointment. I think that they could have done a much better job on that movie.  So in a scale from like one to five I think I'd give it like a two, honestly. Just not really that great, not that entertaining, definitely not the summer blockbuster that we needed this summer.	4.655
My review now is for the movie Nancy Drew,  by Andrew Fleming. Well, Andrew Fleming is the director,  and yeah. So those who are  of course childhood fans, I am as I suppose. I read the Nancy Drew books as a child, and yeah I thought they were really good.  And when I heard there was a movie coming out I was skeptical,  which is not too surprising.  Movies from books are often, well, rushed. Of course, there are exceptions. Lord of the Rings, for one,  and yeah. This one was hmm.  I know Nancy Drew doesn't really make her appearance on the big screen quite as well as she does in the books.  In the books she's a very interesting character, but yet on the big screen, yeah she loses it I feel  and most of the magic was in the imagination, well that's what it seems to be because  I just couldn't get into this movie.  Thought it was quite fast paced and yeah I just,  I couldn't enjoy the movie. Which is sad because I was really looking forward to it. And  the characters try their best to act, but yeah, xxx the story just  was missing something, that kind of Nancy Drew magic and well  it kind of broke my heart. So  if you also loved Nancy Drew as I did as a child then, well,  you could try and watch this but be prepared for disappointment. Go in with low  expectations and you might enjoy this.  But yeah, with the source material that was available this is not  as good as it could have been.	3.697
Hello ExpoTV, today I have another  great  review for a movie currently in theaters.  Live Free or Die Hard and obviously this is starring  Bruce Willis and  of course I forget the rest of the characters I always forget names,  but  Live Free or Die Hard is exactly what it sounds like. It's a mantra for an action movie  and if you love the rest of the Die Hards and you've seen them and you have Die Hard movie nights like I've had,  you're gonna love it.  It's basically the summer's  action hit  before Transformers came out.  But  Live Free or Die Hard  basically if you're like me, if you love to see stuff blowing up, cars flipping in the air,  shoot them up, everything like that,  if it Bruce Willis is  crazy and hardcore as usual,   just like the rest of them, it definitely won't disappoint.   It's definitely something that  is worth the money you got, you've got  to see the rest of the Die Hards. I would definitely, I can't wait until it comes out on DVD and we get out the collection and have another movie night.   It's a perfect edition, and basically if you love the rest of the Die Hards don't even hesitate, go out and see it.  Live Free or Die Hard.	6.055
Hello expotv.  I am doing a review on Ratatouille.  Probably my first or second,  maybe third,  favorite movie of the summer.  Currently in theaters.   Ratatouille was a great movie and it wasn't    just a movie for kids. I mean it wasn't like Shrek where there's a lot of   adult  sort of innuendo and that sort of thing but it's just a great movie.  All my college friends and I went to go see it and we all loved it. I mean we're also sort of into cooking so that could be part of it but it's basically about this rat who has   who can cook. And   he ends up getting lost, and he ends up in France, and he's been dreaming about going to France his whole life and he kind of finds his way, kind of like a    maturation story where the rat finds his way  and  he meets a young guy who  gets  forced into a kitchen and basically they can find them they can help each other out, cause the rat can cook, the guy can't, but the rat needs the guy to cook for him. So they make these amazing dishes and the story is  very fun, there's a lot of great stuff, there's some tense moments that go on, and a little romance and that you'll find out. And it's just a great movie for all ages.  Definitely take the whole family to go see it or  I think any age would really really love it.  And it has a really good message in it to  really being genuine and not selling out and that sort of thing so Ratatouille, definitely go see it.	5.598
 This is a review of the Brazil   DVD.   This is a Terry Gilliam film and film   I really think it's   one of my favorite movies of all so it's,   It paints    dark and humorous picture of dystopia   there's a lot of the ironies of  {noise}   loud xxx on it and,   {laughter}  there's some really funny  comedic xxx to it   Like in terms of  the  comic-book fun of  inefficiencies of bureaucracy and stuff like that    so I think that it's actually really funny, really broad so really well done   and the  visual aspect of it.  {noise}  So I really enjoyed it and I think  there's a lot of xxx marching by the people.  {noise}  xxx I think it's a great movie to watch  it's really funny.	2.38
 The movie Derailed based on a book by James Sigel.  I picked up because I really liked the book. However   I should have known with Xzibit being one of the featured actors that the acting and the,  the general dialogue was gonna be awful.   Xzibit has failed to impress me with his acting ability as most rappers who attempt to  succeed in the movie industry tend to do.   The first  twenty minutes, half hour, work pretty well and then the movie just loses all coherence.   If you're looking for a mindless thrill this may be it for you, however it is lacking a little on the thrill part and all the Hollywood cliches are here, everything from the fake ending   to the way that the characters are portrayed.  The acting's subpar, the screen the screenplay  is disappointing and the directing is awful.   I'd still I'd still I'd still  watch it say just like I would Triple X: State of the Union but it's not,  it's not worth your time if you haven't seen it if you haven't seen it  already.	3.109
Hi, this is my movie review  of the movie   Twenty-Eight Weeks Later  and   first of all, I have to say, I saw the first movie, Twenty-Eight Days Later,  and I thought it was actually quite intriguing despite being really nasty.   I'm actually quite intrigued with the kind of like modern-day zombie movies. I've seen almost every one of them from  the pretty good one to the mediocre one to the really really bad one. Basically,  zombie movies,     nowadays zombie movies   are   based on one concept.   Now it doesn't matter if they call it differently, they're the same.  They basically have some type of virus that  they have and then they bite people and then they infect people  and then they all have you know the walking dead I'm gonna bite people  virus, and  Twenty-Eight  Days Later explored that    and it was set in England and this movie's also set in in  the United Kingdom and it's basically  that they sealed off after the first attack  and    America and the United Nations are opening up Great Britain, they're cleaning up the mess    because they think all the zombies have died or has been fire bombed and exterminated,  so they go   try to bring, resettle Great Britain  with the people who survived and people who escaped.  And the story starts out with a family,  and    the father's reunited reunited  with    the  brother and the sister,  and basically  they're really shattered  that you  know their mom died.   but  one of the twist is that    the movie is that they find the mom  and   that's where the story begins.   I think I think   the movie was  it's okay in terms of plot.  I think   the   mom coming back and  she's being really you know advertised in the trailers as   being really important person, and she is a very important person    in this movie. I think one of the things that kind of bothered me is that when they  brought the character back, the  way they did that was really annoying because they relied on  the children   the characters as being really idiotic. They relied on a lot of  chance events that feels really like  forced and feel very unrealistic. It's like  you're looking at the movie, you're like,  screaming at the movie like what the heck, like, that's so stupid, like  no normal human with normal intelligence would do that, so it's like,  when you,   there's certain parts, like in the beginning where you're just like how could they do that and it just feels so that like the film maker ran out of ideas so they used some cheap idea to, you know, create some drama to   bring the zombies into the film. It it  felt so,  that part was so bad, but   apart from that  you know whole frustration with   I think  bad writing, or you know,  bad plot twist, if you can even say plot twist, it's been advertised,  you know everybody knows that the mother's going to   come back and make a difference and  there's  something, you know, to do with the family member, so like the film has been advertised as that, so   but the way that they did that was just really unoriginal; it was just really bad,    and it just kinda invalidated the entire point of the film because,  if they've done it more creatively and more believably they would have made a really fantastic film, because there are things, there's some good action you know there's some good escaping, good  zombie basher, good shootouts, so  the rest of the film is actually not that bad, just the beginning and the justification for these events, it's  completely unbelievable, so, if you can put that aside,   then you will pay, you will like this movie   from the beginning to end it's got some good points,  but you know if you really hate where  certain plot point feels really really really real unrealistic, then  you probably would not want to watch this movie.	6.683
Hi, this is my movie review of the movie, Sunshine and this is a movie that stars Cillian Murphy  and  Chris Evans as people who from the Earth  who realize that the sun is dying and they are trying to send a payload to the sun to rejuice the sun.    I think the movie has been a little bit overrated.   I didn't like the movie at all. I think it wasn't as good as   I don't think it's as good as like  any science fiction movie. I don't think it's as good as those in space, you know movies, because  I felt not only was the production really cheap,   I I  just didn't really believe that you can have a whole spaceship full of people, never  showing like you  no gravity scenes and  that was, but that was not the majority of the problem though. The majority of the problem  was the movie didn't really have a good plot  as advertised as being cool you know and directed by the same person who did twenty-eight days later and you know, stars Cillian Murphy who's supposed to be a good acting.  But you know what, doesn't matter all of those, it doesn't matter if movies look beautiful. I think what matters the most is the movie has a good plot, it has a feasible plot you know, it's got maybe like a message at the end that's not too cliche  and the movie failed in every aspect in my opinion. I didn't think it was visually stunning. I didn't think the story was interesting. I didn't even, in the end of the movie, I was like {sigh} relieved that the movie was done you know. I couldn't wait to   not watch the movie and I mean I just wanted to fast forward and see what happens in the end. And in the end it was very predictable  it was like, and there was, basically there were some parts of the movie where they questioned like you know  how mentally you know ill the people on board the  spacecraft and you know, that's that's  a really old concept and it's been overdone in so many movies  and I just feel like  that's just one of the most boring film I've seen this year so I absolutely don't recommend it. If you're that big of a fan so Cillian Murphy maybe,  but overall the movie  had like,  it was just like really limited. I don't really think they got creative. I thought because they were on a spaceship it really limited like the story telling and  it was just really bad. It's not good science fiction. It's not, you know, good in space or at least not good action not, it's just  bad.   I don't recommend it.	4.69
I'm here to review this movie  and it's called Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.  And it's rated PG-thirteen.  And it's about  martial arts fighting and   believe it was really based in China and  about  these two master fighers,  and they're all their abilites and the storyline that goes with it's real interesting.  And  this  young woman here,  she  comes out as  a, you know another master fighter but she tries to hide it.  But the stories the story's  okay and the  fight scenes,  you know if you're really, if you're into martial arts and that kind of thing this is a good one, I mean it's  really good choreographed fight scenes.  But  it was   kind of strange and I didn't really understand   a lot about it but.   If you enjoy the martial arts arts  and understand, you know a lot of the things that are behind the martial arts,  this will be an interesting one for you to see but.  For me it was a little bit boring,  and    but you might, you might  see something different in it, so.   It's been out for a little while so  you can find it most anywhere and   the prices are probably around fifteen dollars, maybe a little less.	4.435
Hi. My name is Kaitlyn. I'm doing a review on the movie Taxi with Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon.  Okay. Two thumbs down. This movie was pretty bad.  Not only was it cheesy, but the storyline {sigh} was just dumb.   Supposedly, USA Today says it's hilarious, real belly laughs, but, yeah, it was funny, but it was funny because it was so stupid.   I don't even know why we own this video, to be honest with you.  Maybe it was my husband's, but {sigh} I would not pay money to see this movie or buy this movie. I don't even know why they  paid money to make this movie. I mean, it was pretty bad. I like Queen Latifah and I like Jimmy Fallon, but they just don't do very well together, I guess.  So, anyway, that's my review of this movie. I would not recommend watching this movie.	5.745
 Hi exoitv, my name is xxx and I'm here to talk to you about  the Wayne's World Two DVD. This is the second Wayne's World movie ever made. It's ,  it's funnier and better than the first one. It says you'll laugh again, cry again and hurl again.  It's about these two characters Wayne and Garth who are just really into music.  Rock music actually and   they just  travel and go to concerts and meet famous people and good people. They both also kind of deal with some like relationship problems in the movie but  it's a comedy like all the way through. This movie's really funny and the characters are dressed in like what you normally wouldn't see them in, so that makes it really funny. And   the soundtrack also to this is just really good. It's  kind of like a rock movie so it has a rock soundtrack through the whole thing and just really goes good with the movie. And  you should definitely check this movie out cause it's a really funny movie.  Alright, thanks.	2.38
{noise}  That's right, that's right.  Ferris Bueller's Day off.  This movie  is amazing.    This is a classic from nineteen eighty six.    It's  probably one of the best  high school  comedies  ever made,   this is back when  this is back when I guess Matthew Broderick wasn't  so bad.    This is when Matthew Broderick was in his prime  in my book.  he he  was great in this movie.   And it's just, if you haven't seen this movie seriously  you need to see it like, right now.  Just go like  buy it, I don't know, rent it  if you have but seriously everyone should own this movie.  You should watch this movie at least  ten times in your life, just just  check it out.  It's a classic.  It's funny,  it's charming, it's   it's got kind of the feel of  those eighties classics and like  sixteen candles and stuff like that so.  Just check it out, it's, it's  a great eighties film.  And you're, you won't be disappointed, believe me, it's  too classy for that, so  check it out.	3.559
Hi guys, this review is gonna be for  the Aladdin movie, the two disc special edition platinum edition from Walt Disney.   Aladdin is a fantastic movie. What I really enjoy about Aladdin is Robin Williams is the voice of the Genie, he's one of my favorite comedians.   What's special about this platinum edition is it does have all these great extras on, the extras that I love, which I think is a little ironic now.  Cause there's actually a video of Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey singing "A Whole New World".   Again, I just think that's very ironic now.   I'm gonna show you real quick, I've got a clip from the movie Aladdin here for you  and this is actually when Aladdin  goes down to get the lamp.   He, him and Abu, his monkey, go down there. Now Abu is actually my favorite character besides . I guess it's a toss up between the Genie who's played by Robin Williams and  Abu, just because I tend to really like the cute little   characters in all the Disney movies and Abu is one of my favorites.   Again, this is a great movie.   It   brings home to your children, you know, all those different   I know I remember when I was little, my parents used to tell me different   stories about   Aladdin, magic carpets, those types of things. But this story more than any others is just really great.   The the  romance between Aladdin and Jasmin is fantastic. Again, the humor of the Genie is spot on.   I love Robin Williams in this movie. I can highly recommend it. It's Aladdin, the two disc platinum edition from Disney. Thanks.	5.802
Hi ExpoTV.   I'm Alexis and I am a self-declared movie junkie.  Continuing the theme of sharing good movies with you,  I introduce  The Boondock Saints.  The Boondock Saints  is one of those kind of  cult movies that are almost too popular to be a cult movie,  that are actually genuinely brilliant.  This is about  two Catholic brothers, twins, who decide that it's their responsibility to kill  all of the evil people in the world.  Starting you know, with their city.  It has Willem Dafoe in it who  I love. And it's just.  It's good.   I think it actually wins an award for profanity  in just the sheer quantity of it.  And it's almost  needlessly violent which sometimes you really just need a movie that's gratuitously violent.  So highly recommended,  definitely not for children.  But it's well acted, it's well done,  if you don't mind the profanity, the lines are very witty very clever and it's just.  This is a good movie.	5.745
Hi, this is mom of three for Expo TV. Today I'd like to review the Disney DVD Hercules.  This film was originally released in nineteen ninety seven. It's rated G and it's ninety-three minutes long.  It follows the story of Hercules who has god parents, but he was raised on earth. He never fit in. He has this abnormal amount of strength and he doesn't know where it comes from and he finally finds out that his dad is Zeus, but he has to be do a true heroic act before he can go and live with the gods in a temple.  He enlists the friend, the help of his friend   Pegasus,  his friend Phil, rather, to help him do this. But all this time, there is a villain of the the name of Hades, who's trying to come along and make it so he can't do his heroic deed. He uses Meg to try to get him derailed from his mission.  Hercules is very trusting and even though Phil does not trust Meg, they don't know what's happening.  I found this film to be one of the worst Disney movies. It, I don't even know how it got a G rating. It's very violent and it's not one that I would recommend. The only bonus feature on the DVD is the making of Hercules feature. So, for twenty dollars, I don't think this is a DVD that I would recommend.	4.243
Hi. The  DVD that I'm reviewing today is Elf  starring Will Ferrell and James Caan. This was a great Christmas movie when it came out. Will Ferrell, of course, is hysterically funny. You remember him from Saturday Night Live.   Basically what this is about is this  little boy or this little baby who was  Buddy,  is in an orphanage and he  accidentally climbs into Santa's bag and Santa takes him back to the North Pole with him. And when he gets there, he discovers he has this little baby there. So instead of bringing him back to the city, they keep him at the North Pole and they raise him up as an elf. And he doesn't really realize that he's not an elf until he gets to be much older. As you can see, here's a clip of him as he gets  much older and then he realizes he doesn't really fit in with the other elves.  Okay. Let's watch a little clip.  {movie_55.464_67.172}  So the elves all love him and they try to make him fit in, but he realizes that he just doesn't fit in. And he decides that he needs to venture back to the city and   find out about his real parents, because Santa actually ends up telling him  who his real parents are. And this this  movie is about his his  trip back to the city. And once he gets there, he  he meets his father and his father actually  has another family, and so he gets to know them. He goes to work in a department store in the Christmas department and  he meets a girl there.  And so it's a really cute movie.  I recommend this for anybody, especially at the Christmas season. It really gets you in that Christmas spirit. He  it's just hysterically funny. There's so many things that happen, and it's a really good movie to watch.	5.802
Hi, may name is Leah and today I'm going to do a movie review for you and that movie review is for the movie  No End in Sight, which   I actually saw recently and  if you don't know No End in Sight is actually a documentary film which is about the Iraq war and   what is going on in Iraq right now and it actually gives you a history too of   a timeline of the start of the Iraq war and some different things that happened.   When I first went to see this movie I was a little bit skeptical because   well I don't really believe in political bashing and ,  you know,  I like documentaries to be just that, to be  documentaries without a lot of bias to it and when you think about  a lot of the feelings that are surrounding the Iraq war you think that you are going to see something fairly biased,  but it actually turned out to be one of the best documentaries I have ever seen because  it  I learned more about the Iraq war than I think I could have ever known reading the news or anything else.  They had a lot of really great sources to back up their statements and it wasn't like a political bashing stuff.  I would say the movie is not pro-war, it's not pro-Bush, but it's also not  just  coming out with outrageous claims or being sarcastic.  It's very   very informative and  it actually gives you good insight into what's happening in Iraq and if you haven't    if you're confused, I guess that is, about the things that go on in Iraq I would definitely recommend that you go see this movie because it helps for me to clear up a lot of   ideas.  The people they interview are people who work in Iraq who had  executive type of positions  when America first  entered Iraq and also  soldiers, lots of different people.  So I definitely recommend you see it, it's a really good movie. And again it's No End in Sight  and you can see it at your local movie theater.	3.464
I laugh just thinking about reviewing this movie. Napoleon Dynamite    this movie was made on a very, very low budget {laughter}  and   most of the people that, or all the people in it that are played in this movie are virtually nobodies. You've got Jon  Heder who's now  been in many other movies but this is really his breakout film and these were actually the movie came about  I guess by some short    movies they did on MTV. I never saw them, and then they said hey this is working for us, let's  make a movie out of it.  The first time I watched this movie I did not get it, I thought wow there's no plot in that movie  and it was not funny to me, it was just weird. The second time I laughed so hard I cried. I {laughter} it's it's  hilarious. You have to go to see the deleted scenes too, they're fantastic. Really, really funny  and most people who watch this movie don't know but  the director and  co-writer and John Heder are both  members of the Church of Jesus Christ  of Latter Day Saints, Mormons,  and so  they've got a little bit of the Mormon subculture stuff going in that you would find in a  middle of nowhere Idaho or Utah town   so to me, being  Mormon, I find that extremely hilarious and   really good.  I recommend this movie. I find that it's  really not so funny to  people like my parent's age group {laughter}   but my age group and, you know, younger teenagers find it hilarious. So, five out of five stars, you gotta see it. Napolean Dynamite.	5.802
Hello, this is Jocelyn.  I'm going to tell you about a movie that's really great and full of excitement.  It's Live Free or Die Hard with Bruce Willis.  I like the first three movies that came off as very personal  and they were located in one spot.  This movie moves around quite a bit,  from north to northeast and it's quite interesting because it does not  lose your sense of concentration.  He is fighting this time a bunch of really bad people that are taking over a computer  that has an enormous amount of very important information on it.  He really  succeeds in this movie because he shows that he can still have  the right stuff, it's like a good old fashioned    western or very just a good old flick that has a lot of action in it.  Bruce Willis is known for   really active he has a fight he looks like he has a fight and doesn't come out with a  spotless tuxedo on with no blemishes no scars.  And so that makes it very enjoyable for us that like to see  the real stuff.  He   has only one yippe ki yay in it, so he has moved away from more of the  one liners,  and there's so much action, there's   great  pyrotechnics in it that are just absolutely amazing.   The whole movie is a little bit different.  But it did not lose its appeal. It was given a  A minus rating from  viewers and a B plus from critics.  That is one yippee ki yay.	5.0
Hello everyone, my name Is Bryan, and I'd like to talk to you about Apocalypse Now, the complete dossier.  This  is both versions of Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now, starring Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Rovert Duvall, Sam Bottoms, Larry Fishburne and   I forget the guy who played chef. Frederick Forest, yes. There's  both versions of the movie on this  two disc DVD set.   There's the original theatrical cut which is like two and a half hours long and then there's the  expanded cut that came out  in two-thousand-one which was titled Apocalypse Now: Redux, which is French for  something. I don't know French.  But yeah, it's like a, it's a much longer cut, it's like a hundred and nintety minutes or two-hundred minutes or something like that. And both versions are very good, both versions have commentary by Francis Ford Coppola and if you have not heard a commentary by Francis Ford Coppola then you're in for a treat because they're very informative and he just seems like a really friendly guy, you just want to, you know,  go to dinner with him or something, or have him make you some pasta or something like, I don't know. And  he just seems like a really, really accessible nice guy. And   special features are really interesting. And   it's really good, it's a it's a  they're both, they're both the same movie, one more so than the other, but  they're both really good and you should buy this thing.	5.0
Corbin here reviewing the HD DVD version of three hundred.  This is atcually a flipper disc, which means it has both the regular DVD and the HD DVD.   It can be used in bith players.   This movie tells the story of three hundred Spartans who fight the Persian empire, a huge army. It's roughly based on   a real real war, real army, real people and   this movie is absolutely beautiful. It  takes a lot of the cinematography from the graphic novel, which is where the story came from.  And  it looks amazing on HD.   I have it playing in the background as you can see. And the video the picture doesn't look as well as good as   it should, but just because of the transfer but I  can assure you this is a really good quality  disc.   It is very very violent. It is rated R. It definitely deserved and earned that   rating.  It's not for children, there is some brief nudity, but mainly it's the violence.   There's a ton of extra features. The HD DVD version actually has picture in picture which shows a small picture in the corner with the blue screen version and it has commentary which is really interesting to see how they did the shots, you know, with green screen and how they muddled up the  picture. But   overall this is a great set. It's definitely worth twenty-five bucks and you can play it on a regular DVD so you really have nothing to lose. So check it out, three hundred.	5.745
Hello, today I would like to tell you of about a very heart warming story, and it's called Kayla.   This is about a little boy named Sam,  whose father who was a famous explorer disappeared while he was out on an expedition  and eight years later, his mom remarries assuming that you know that that  Sam's father is dead   Sam has a hard time adjusting he doesn't want to face the fact that  his father's not going to come home  he's in a new town, new school, having a really difficult time meeting new friends.  Well he meets a dog   a wild dog that resembles a dog that his father had on his sled team.  And everybody feels like this dog is dangerous except Sam and he wants  he wants this dog to be a part of his life   really there  they come to each other at the most important times of their lives Sam really needed someone, he needed a friend  and this dog really needed someone to take care of him and let everyone else know that it's a good dog.  Again it's a very heart warming story, it's very sweet  my daughter's eight years old she loves dog stories and this is one of her favorites   you know if you have a dog lover in your family, especially a child  this is a great movie for them to watch it's called Kayla again, Kayla's the dog and Sam is the little boy   pick it up we bought it at Walmart  but I know it's available online as well   it was a very inexpensive buy it was like less than ten dollars so, it's a great buy pick it up  I think that you and your children will enjoy watching it.	5.745
Hi, I would like to tell you about Walt Disney's Beauty and The Beast: An Enchanted Christmas.   The Enchanted Christmas.   This is a movie about Belle and the Beast and   she does her best to actually move him   invoking the spirit of Christmas.   A lot of the characters that were in the first one, the inanimate objects   that actually have faces and personalities and voices and the ability to move  are back.   It's it's  very very entertaining.   Very cute for young children.   One thing that's a little bit problematic is the fact that  the Beast had already turned back into a prince and all the objects in the castle, have already  returned to human form   in the first movie. So,  chronologically it doesn't make a lot of sense. But it is a good   Christmas movie. It's a good holiday movie to have around the house to watch with the kids  during the season.   Again, it's The beauty and The Beast: The Enchanted Christmas.   It's got the same characters. Belle and the Beast and the candlestick and the tea pot, Misses Pots and Chip her little son and the mantle clock and   all of the little personalities that made the first movie great. You'll find em again in this one.   I recommend it for your family. It's  Walt Disney's Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas.	4.082
Hello my name's Karen  and I'm gonna review for you the movie Elf.    Honestly right up front I'll tell you that I'm not a person that likes to watch  a seasonal movies out of season.   Elf being a Christmas movie.    This one I don't mind watching any time.   It stars Will Ferrell.   I really enjoy watching  Will Ferrell in this movie.   He plays elf.  And he has    slipped into Santa's bag  in an orphanage so he's raised raised  in   the North Pole as an elf.    He finds out that he was adopted, he is human  and this   takes him on a journey to meet his father.   It's funny as usual   Will Ferrel's just   out of the box on this one.      And also stars   Bob Newhart.   Haven't seen him around for a while so he's very,  funny too.    The whole movie is a Christmas theme about an elf who  learns that he's human.  He's on the track to find his father.   And then he also  is gonna teach some people about  spreading  Christmas cheer  all around the year and what the true meaning of Christmas is.   I think   this movie is    PG.  And  it is   ninety-five minutes long, so it's not a very long movie but  even though it is a Christmas I suggest you watch it any time of the year.   You'll you'll  really enjoy Will Ferrell.	1.915
Hi, I'm Bruce and today I'm reviewing The Host which is now out on DVD. This is actually a Japanese film, it's a monster movie. It was  very well  reviewed on the   the movie poster  and so I was  taken in to  check it out and see if it was a good as the reviewers said. Unfortunately it was not.  What you're watching right now is the scene where  this monster, this  sea creature is first found.  Where it's about to drop in the water and  mayhem begins.  But basically it's the story of a dysfunctional Japanese family that  ends up coming together in order to save  the young girl that is  taken  by this  sea monster.    I definitely would not recommend it.   We actually had to skip through some of the movie because it just got so drawn out.  But   if you enjoy seeing foreign films  you might  have a little fun with it.  We  enjoyed seeing the  the subtitles  versus the, the  dubbed voices, dubbed American voices  and how the dialogue  differed from the subtitles on the screen.  and so you might enjoy that.   But all in all it's it's  not a very good movie and so I would not recommend it.  But  like I said it might be  good for a laugh  if you really like monster movies or if you  like Japanese films. So anyway that's my review of The Host, now out on DVD.   Available at your local video store or Redbox. Thanks.	2.646
Hi there, my name is Shelley, and this is a dvd review of the movie Patch Adams starring Robin Williams.  And this movie is based on a true story about a medical  student who   gets into a lot of trouble because  he believes that   patients should   be known by their name and by, as a human being rather than just a chart or a number.  And   this movie is a wonderful heartwarming story   it's also very funny in in  parts because it stars Robin Williams, so  he does a lot of     tricks and jokes, and and  humor to cheer up the patients in the hospital.   It's not  what you would consider a comedy,   because it does have a storyline that, you know is very sad he does have a romantic interest  in the movie as well. And it is based on a true story.    But this movie is rated PG, it lasts an hour and fifty-six minutes.  And   it is a very heartwarming story, something that  a movie that,   people just about everyone would like. People of all ages  would appreciate this movie and   find it heartwarming.   But it's called Patch Adams and it stars Robin Williams.  So check it out.	3.697
Hello Expo TV, today I will be reviewing Live Free or Die Hard, otherwise known as Die Hard four.   It's the story of John McClane, you know, policeman  extraordinaire who gets put in extraordinary situations in every movie.   This time computer hackers have   pretty much shut down and taken over the whole United States   and   he actually he meets up with a hacker  not one of the ones who planned it, but one of the ones who was unwittingly  duped into helping with the  execution of it.   He's gotta keep the guy alive long enough to   save his life and to solve the case and pretty much the United States.   Action packed, all the way through.  I was surprised after the fourth one cause   the third one wasn't too bad but I didn't think they would have another  full movie worth of   material. But, it was actually a really good movie. Really action packed and the interaction between Bruce Willis and the hacker   really funny stuff. I forget the kid's name. He's the guy from   Dodgeball. But   really really funny and   really good action.   A lot of good stunt work.   A lot of explosions and gun fighting and and   some cool computer stuff.   Kevin Smith does a cameo in it   just a really really good movie all the way through.  I was pleasantly surprised by Live Free or Die Hard.   So if you're in the mood for a good action flick, that is definitely one to check out. Especially if you've seen the other three and you just wanna round out the series.  Definitely worth watching. So   go out and check it out.  Enjoy.	5.354
Hey, Summer here for ExpoTV. Today I'm reviewing for you a movie that I truly dislike. The movie is eight millimeters with Nicolas Cage and Joaquin Phoenix. Now, the basic premise behind this movie is Nicolas Cage is a cop, and he's trying his best to find out what happened with a six-year-old crime. So he is reinvestigating an old crime.  And in the process, he finds  an integrated trail of mystery, murder, thrillers. And all of it is being captured on eight millimeter film.   I did not like the storyline of the movie, first of all.  I I  liked even less the fact that there was actually on film  violence, rape, and murder. It, it  was on film, and then  they showed you clips of these films. And I I  wasn't, you know, thrilled with that. I mean, there can be, I've watched many, many psychological thrillers that were really, really good. And they didn't need to show this. I understand that the basis of the movie is the eight millimeter film basis, but it could have been done in a different way. I mean, the the  people that were involved in this movie were the writer that wrote this was the same writer that wrote Seven. And  Joel Schumacher, he he  was the one that directed this movie. And and  they've done such great movies that that  were so successful in the past without the usage of of  this type of film and footage.  So I didn't like eight millimeter. I'm going to give it one star because I just don't like the the  basis behind how the movie was filmed and the way that the eight millimeter film was integrated into the footage.  So, eight millimeter. If you want to watch something like this, you go on with your bad self. I do not like the film. And I will not watch it again. It's rated R. And it is with Nicolas Cage and Joaquin Phoenix. One out of five stars. I don't like this one.	7.0
I wanna tell you about a classic Walt Disney movie called Beauty and the Beast. This movie  actually won the Golden Globe for best picture and   also was nominated, was actually the only  cartoon ever nominated for an Academy Award. In this movie it's   has a peasant girl named Belle. She lives with her father,  and her father ends up getting lost out in the woods and is trying to find his way back home.   in this scene of the movie it shows Belle's father,  he's just come up to the castle of the Beast and he ends up being taken prisoner.  Belle comes to the castle and decides to change positions with her dad so her dad can be let go.  In this movie you'll see that Belle discovers, she's very beautiful, and the Beast is very ugly, she discovers that the Beast is not  as ugly as he seems and he's very beautiful on the inside.   the Beast was given a rose during this movie by an elderly lady and he has  until the last petal of the rose falls off to find love or he will stay the Beast forever. So you'll need to go rent the movie or buy the movie and watch it and see if  he stays the Beast forever or if he turns into a handsome prince. Again this is Beauty and the Beast  by Walt Disney.	3.109
Hello, ExpoTV. This is Kevin and this is a review on three hundred. And if you're wondering about this movie, yes, everything that you have heard about this movie are true, unless you're hearing absolutely ridiculous and ludicrous things. This movie is one of the best movies ever orchestrated and brought to the big screen. This movie is absolutely amazing.   Written and directed by Frank  Miller, who wrote the graphic novel on the war between the three hundred Spartans and the Persian army. Absolutely amazing.  Some of the battle scenes are just breathtaking the way that it is animated and stuff.  I can't I can't  describe it. I mean, I'm absolutely speechless trying to do a review on this movie, because it is that great.  If you haven't seen three hundred yet, I don't know why you're even watching this review. Just honestly, if you've been hearing all this great stuff about it, it's all true. I guarantee it. It is absolutely a phenomenal movie. And  Leonidas and his three hundred Spartans is  really, really  a great tale. And they're battling against the Persian army. It's very, very, very good movie. And I can't say it enough, because I've enjoyed this movie since it was in theaters. And I watch it all the time on DVD. And  I definitely recommend it to any, to anyone  who wants to see it.  You know, it's really bloody and stuff in some parts. So I don't think it's really good for kids. But, at the same time, I really wouldn't even care, because it's that good of a movie.  But just because it is rated R, you might want to preview it before you let your kids watch it. But it's a definite must-have DVD to anyone who liked Troy or Sin City or anything like that. It's a great movie. So  go check it out if you get the chance. It's three hundred.	6.403
Hey there Expo tv, Summer here and today I have a review for you of Silent Hill.  Now Silent Hill the video game was truly a scary video game. I played this game and and  I was left  basically with night terrors, I had no idea what I was gonna do, I couldn't sleep I was scared.  So when I watched this movie I was ready.  I was ready I slept half the day I was ready to be up all night frightened all out of my wits.  And I watched the movie and was left just stunned.  This is the least  scary movie I have ever watched in my entire life.  The movie from beginning to end  does not even begin to employ the scariness of the video game and I know that's what they were trying for. And  I I I  didn't like the storyline, I didn't like  how they explained the things that were happening in Silent Hill.  And I just didn't like the movie, so  this is Silent Hill. It's two hours long,  it's rated R for strong horror and violence, gore, disturbing images, some language,  and I would not watch this movie again.  I was very upset with  myself for having purchased the movie  and basically being left with something I'm not gonna watch ever again. So,  Silent Hill gets one star from me, it did not scare me, there was no ha moments or anything of that sort it was just plain old fashioned bad.  Bad try, bad attempt with some gore thrown in. Not a good movie.  Do not watch Silent Hill.	6.683
Hey there expotv, Summer here. Today we're reviewing the DVD Freedomland. Now Freedomland has Samuel L Jackson and Julianne Moore. It is rated R for some language and some violent content and it runs about  two hours long. Now I want to tell you this from the beginning.  I do not like this movie. I don't see any sense in Freedomland ever being made. I understand that the movie was based on the bestselling novel, I understand that it was acted well, I understand that Julianne Moore totally was out of character by playing the person she played in this movie, but I didn't see the premise behind the movie. Now  the premise of course is is  basically a a  white woman living in the not so  white section of the city,  has her car stolen and her son is in the backseat supposedly and  there is a frenzy. The entire town is trying to find her son. They're looking and looking and looking, and she's got a history of using drugs, and she has a history of being a liar and not not  acting appropriately and then not being  you know a person with  everything there, all her marbles together in a row. And   that this  to me was very, very similar to some news event that had actually occurred. And then that's when it fell off for me. When I'm watching a movie of something you know with with  actors of this caliber I expect to watch something that's new and unique and I didn't find that with this movie. So for me  Freedomland was a total waste of time. It was a total waste of money. I hated the movie. I don't think Samuel L Jackson should have been in it and I think that Julianna Moore lowered herself to play the person in this movie. I hated the events that unfolded and I hated the ending. So this is a zero star for me if I could give it, but it'll get one just because it had decent actors in it.	5.745
Hi. This is Mike Marvin with the review of the two-thousand seven version of Halloween.   I personally think that the original Halloween is the greatest horror film of all time you know.  It's I mean {sigh}  countless articles of it written about how it's out of the slasher genre and all that stuff but for some reason a lot of people today say that the film doesn't really  hold up, it doesn't age well  but I think those people are too cynical.   I saw the movie when I was like thirteen or fourteen and   it scared the crap out of me and this was before I seen a ton of horror film and granted you're kinda a babe in the wood if you are seeing it that that  young and you know that    uneducated about horror films but it really did and I also showed it to my thirteen year old brother recently and so I can definitely attest it and it can still scare the crap out of people who have never seen it and haven't seen a lot of horror movies.   First {sigh}  I  have to go on to say  before I get into this any further is that I really don't like Rob Zombie.   I mean as a film maker you know, I have nothing against him as a person or anything it's just that his films are like totally for me style over substance and the style just gives me a headache.   It's the the over saturated colors and the  MTV editing. It's just that it's bad so   {sigh} not surprisingly that I really hated the remake of Halloween.   There are some pretty good cinematography I guess and  and the score at least   when they started doing variations on  John Carpenters classic Halloween theme,   that's pretty cool but other than that the film is it's it's  like totally worthless, totally useless to me.   It it's  so mean spirited {umm) like there is no elegance about it like there was in the original Halloween  and   {sigh} everybody says this but seriously,  why do you have to explain Michael Meyers. There are so many scenes where just like Michael Meyers and  Doctor Loomis.  Michael Meyers is a kid and Doctor Loomis sitting in a room and talking about like Micheal's feelings and why he does like why did he kill his sister and all this stuff.  Who cares?  Who cares?  Michael Meyers is the boogie man, that's it that's all you need to know.  He's the boogie man that's why he's evil. Why is he evil? Cause he's evil. No one cares.  When  they got into Halloween four and five and six especially five and six,  they tried to explain everything,  they tried to say he was you know   a druid experiment gone wrong and all this crap that doesn't matter. I don't care  that's actually slightly less like horrific {laugh} of story telling for me than Rob Zombie saying like  he's  a bad kid cause his mom's a stripper and  his dad was real mean.  I mean come on that lame that's just that's just like completely demystifying one of the greatest. you know. horror villains of all time and I know that in Halloween two they start to tried to explain it by saying that,  you know Lorrie was his sister and all this stuff but,  I don't know. I'm rambling. I'm sorry.  Basically this film was a huge huge huge waste of time {laugh}  not to be cruel but, it's horrible and  really just another notch in the very crappy of Mister Rob Zombie's film career.	7.0
What's up expo tv, goob here.   Today I'm going to review  Man of the Year  starring Robin Williams.  It's movie about  Robin Williams playing a  late night comedian  who decides he wants to become president.  So he runs for president and due to  some computer glitches,  he wins.   That's Christopher Walken's in it, Lewis Black,   few other people.  It's rated PG-thirteen   I would rate it NS for never see, because it is extremely boring.   I found myself just  losing complete interest  halfway through the movie.   They, it's like they abandoned the premise.  He gets elected and then suddenly he goes from a comedian to a real politician and it gets real,  it just gets boring it's not funny.   Even the part where he's running for president is not funny, it's just,  there's hardly any jokes.  And it's weird because I like   the real life character that he's,  you know, portraying,  John Stewart or Stephen Colbert.  You know I love those guys but.  Suddenly when Robin Williams takes over in the movie it's just like wow, he's not boring, he's not funny like they are.  It's just not interesting.   I don't even remember how it ends,  I got was so bored with it I was, wasn't  even paying attention.  I started doing other stuff.   And it was a struggle just to make it all the way through it. So  if you want to, you know, watch a bad movie and bore yourself to death,  check out {laugh} Man of the Year. Otherwise  stay away from it because it's not good.	6.055
My name is Leslie and today I would like to do a DVD review for you  of Scooby Doo: Where's My Mummy?  If you have a Scooby Doo fan in your house they will,  they're sure to enjoy this movie. I have a six year old son who's a big Scooby Doo fan, and he loves this one. This one ranks right up there with his favorite Scooby Doo films.   In this movie  Scooby Doo and his gang they travel to Egypt and help solve some  jewel mysteries inside of the pyramids.  Just as a warning some of the characters in this, I know there's lots of monsters in Scooby Doo movies, but this particular mummy really scared the heck out of my four year old daughter when she walked into the room, it really scared her. So  just a warning for small children, it might frighten them a bit, but my six year old loves it and thinks this is just the greatest movie. There are lots of special features included in this DVD.  it says that a a  pyramid of extras. There's national geographic, Scooby Doo the Curse of the Lost Lunch,  there's Scooby Doo rap music video that my son thinks is hilarious. There's mummy's bonus deleted scenes, and there's mysterious voices. You can go behind the scenes and see the  the actors who give the voices to Scooby Doo characters. As a parent I really enjoyed seeing that. And then Escape from the Egg  Chamber challenge. This is a game that's interactive that my son likes to play. So again if you have a Scooby Doo fan in your house and you have do not yet own Scooby Doo: Where's My Mummy? it's an excellent film  that includes lots of different features and bonus features when you purchase the DVD. Run out and get it for your Scooby Doo fan.	7.0
Tonight I want to review the DVD movie called Miss Congeniality. It stars Sandra Bullock, Michael Caine, Benjamin Bratt, Candice Bergen and William Shatner.  Now William Shatner to me is a very funny guy and he plays a really funny part in this movie, and I love Michael Caine. Of course Sandra Bullock is a good actor.  It's put out by Warner Brothers and it's rated PG-thirteen.   The plot is  the Miss America pageant is   been threatened.   Someone has been making anonymous   phone calls and letters.  So the FBI   goes undercover  and infiltrates to protect  the   the other girls and also try to  find out, you know, who it is to spoil the plot, and of course Sandra Bullock is the FBI agent that goes undercover.  Now, you know, she starts off as this  really tough FBI slob kind of agent that they have to turn into a Miss  Miss America contestant.   Michael Caine is hired to do the work because he is the    one of the best people to train these type of things.  It is a very good movie.  I I  really recommend it, it it's  fun to watch.   It's Miss Congeniality, it's put out by Warner Brothers and it's still available on DVD for about nine dollars.	4.243
Hi this is a review for the movie  Blue Collar Comedy Tour,  it's playing behind me  and actually what this movie is about is you have  the four stars of the movie and that's Jeff Foxworthy,  Bill Engvall, Ron White, and Larry the Cable Guy, and it's actually a  movie about their comedy shows  and with  little bits and pieces mixed in it's like their stand up routines and than some ins and out's between it.   Unfortunately I didn't think that this was the funniest movie, so I guess what it really comes down to is this movie is sort of like it takes stand up comedian's doing their act  you put it into a movie and ya throw in some separate parts where their you know you're going into sidelines of of  what's going on and that's kind of what this movies about.   Unfortunately it falls pretty flat for me. It's rated  PG for some sexually related type of humor.   I didn't think it was really very funny and parts of it were boring and  the only one that was really,  pretty funny was Larry the Cable Guy the other one's you you  know didn't live up to their reputations so  very disappointing movie out of four I probably would give   Blue Collar Comedy Tour about a one and a half.	3.109
Hi, today I'm gonna talk to you about Ratatouille.  It's a animation.  It's a animated movie.  I went with my cousin to show her. She wanted to go.  And actually I thought it wouldn't be that great for me but it was a pretty good comedy.  It's animated  the animation look  they're not realistic but they look pretty funny.   The story line is pretty simple. The rat wants to be a chef.   Basically my opinion on that would be take, if you have any kids or brothers or sisters younger than you,   take them.  They would love it a lot. My cousin loved it.  For them it was pretty funny cause you don't see a rat cook everyday.  Yeah, so there is humor, there is tragedy, there is some sad parts there are some love parts.   I would give that movie four our of five cause  it's not for my age category but for young kids it is great.	3.559
Hi expo, my name's Tim and tonight I would like to do a review.  I would like to do a review on the DVD movie that everyone loves,  the classic Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.  Now the Last Crusade is number three in the series of three movies  based upon the  the character starring Harrison Ford, and also in this we introduce a little bit more about Harrison Ford's character and his dad, that's played by Sean Connery. Now I picked this movie up at Best Buy for nineteen-ninety-nine  and it's it's  a great, fun movie. Again he's  chasing another relic, he's battling against the Nazis you could see and   it's another fun adventure. We also get to see another side of him as a young Indiana Jones and what kind of drove him to be where he was today and  also where he gets his patented whip from. So   this has been remastered with THX quality sound. It also has special features such as  interviews with the cast and crew, original TV spots when it had first came out. And it does  go behind the scenes and match up  historical facts  with the movie. So it tells you what is really kind of made up, and where  the truth was stretched a little bit, and where it was right parallel with it, so. I would suggest anybody go out and get Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade on DVD tonight.	5.686
Expo TV, you caught me watch Gladiator.   This movie's starring Russell Crowe, which is probably one of my favorite actors, definitely top three.   The movie is two hours and thirty-five minutes long and it's rated R for intense graphic combat.   Even though it's two and a half hours long, the movie goes by really fast and it's really good and because it did win five Academy Awards and it was best picture.  So   It's about how Russell Crowe is a like  a very high  commander for the   I guess the Holy  Roman Empire and the king dies and the son doesn't like him. And just, if in the background you just saw, that's his son right there, doesn't like him. And   so when his father dies, he basically tries to get rid of Russell Crowe and he then becomes like  a slave, which then he is sold into the gladiator business and  it's how he  tries to become this this  this great gladiator.   So definitely check out this movie. I would give it a five out of five.  So, Gladiator, with Russell Crowe.	4.69
Expotv you caught me watching Jackass: The Movie. This one is rated R for dangerous, sometimes extremely crude, stunts, language, and nudity. And it is, it's  eighty-four minutes long  so it's not that long,  which is kind of a disappointment cause it was so funny I wanted it to be like three hours long. But they came out with a sequel so that's good.   This movie basically takes off where like the  seasons   left off. It's just a bunch of guys, like Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera,  Chris Pontius, Steve-o, Dave England, Ryan Dunn doing their dumb stunts that they always do  and  and basically hurting  themselves really, really, really bad.    But  It  what's funny for us for them to for them to  hurt themself.  Some stuff stuff they do is Steve-o gets a tattoo in like the in like the  offroad desert.   They like joust each other, they do a bunch of funny stuff. So if you want to see a a  really funny movie and like nudity and throwing up and stuff like that don't bother you then  definitely checkout Jackass. I'll give it a five out of five.	4.546
I want to tell you about a DVD.   It's Gosford Park. Now this is, you know,  award winner.  The cast is just incredible.   Helen Mirren and  just everybody.  I really, really, really wanted to like this movie.  I am not a fan of it. I bought the DVD  basically because  I heard it was really, really good, it got a lot of good ratings but I was not, I'm not thrilled with it at all.  I found a lot of the acting to be quite pretentious and  it was  supposed to be a mystery and  I pretty much figured out who was gonna die and who did it   well before the movie  was even halfway through. I thought it was kind a heavy handed storytelling.  But it's very pretty to look at.  The costumes are great. The acting is for the most part pretty good. There's a few people on there who was, I thought was a bit ham handed with their acting.   I really can't recommend anybody buying this film because it's not something you want to watch over. It's one of those "oh, okay,  I'm done with this" type of movie and   so I really wish I had  maybe previewed it, or someone had given me an honest review of it. Cause I just found it   boring.  Honestly it was boring.  and I'm a fan of British mysteries, a big fan of British mysteries and of British  {noise} in the countryside type of shows so I was very unhappy with how bad this one turned out to be. So I  would definitely  recommend don't waste your money on it.	5.066
This is my review of Indiana Jones and the Lost Ark.  This is my review of Indiana Jones and the Lost Ark. Now this is the famous Indiana Jones movie that has the infamous   boulder scene in it, where the rock is  rolling down after them and they have to run out of the way. And once again this is the Indiana Jones action  thriller. This is about a professor  that is  an archaeologist and he is portrayed by   Hanson Ford. This is  the first Indiana Jones movie  and this is  directed by Steven Spielberg. This is an absolutely wonderful film. Now these were made in the eighties so the graphics are  and the special effects are a little less  ordinary  than they are today.  But this takes you back to  good movie making and it was a really great movie.  And what this one is about is that they are in search of the lost ark, and it's kind of like Pandora's box.  And he has his rival archaeologist that is always trying to steal his thunder and take his prizes after he's captured them for him.  But this is a really great movie, and this is one that you can sit back on the couch and watch over and over. It's a great rainy day movie  that will just  absolutely thrill you and surprise all throughout it.   So try Indiana Jones and the Lost Ark. This is a keeper for your collection.	4.726
Hi Expo friends, this is Jill.  I'd like to take a minute to tell you about one of my favorite movies, the silliest I've ever seen. My family loves it, especially my four year old, it is called  Dinosaur. This is a Disney movie and we love it.  This movie  stars many different  characters we have here a family of lemurs.  And this family of lemurs raises a  dinosaur named Aladar. And Aladar  is the only one of his kind left   his egg was in an unfortunate accident.  All of the eggs in his nest were destroyed which left him by himself. The egg was taken by a big pterodactyl like bird and dropped into several different situation by different animals and what not and ends up in this tree and the lemurs find him.  And this movie is about Aladar living with his family of lemurs.  They go through many many different adventures and trials including   a comet that comes and hits the Earth and their home island is destroyed but they end up moving to another one.  And  we just love it, it's a great story and there's Aladar when he's just a baby.  We love it, I can't say enough good things about it. There are though a couple,  two or three scenes that are extremely loud and intense and may scare small children.  But other than that,  it's just great, we love it.  Once again, this is Dinosaur by Walt Disney,  the colors on the movie are fabulous, the story is great. We watch it all the time.  Thanks.	6.403
{movie}  Hey what's up Expo videos, I'm here to talk about Napoleon Dynamite.  {movie}  Everybody, I'm mute it just to talk but everybody knows Napoleon Dynamite. It's like the new movie. It's like the  the new teenage movie to watch. It's like a big hit.   Napoleon Dynamite is definitely a classic comedy of our age I guess you could say.   This is something that you'll be showing your kids just cause you know,   maybe Sixteen Candles or like   other movies like that   would be like a movie that your parents showed you or something. But this is definitely something you're gonna show your kids cause it's hilarious,  and it's hilarious in a different way and a lot of people don't  appreciate it as much  as xxx it is because they just kinda think it's funny but I think this is creatively done because I'm into like a weird humor, I guess you could say, and there's like   like hidden humor in here just that   with editing and continuity and   just the way things are produced that makes it humorous in that aspect as opposed to just   the way he is. And it's  intelligently made I think. One of the best comedies out there of our age as opposed to like, those other comedies that are actually really stupid with just bad bad  jokes and what not.   Definitely something to check into. You can tell this is made by   film students.   But it's really good, I really enjoy it. Napoleon Dynamite.	4.69
Hi, I'm here to review the movie The Maltese Falcon, starring Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor.   The Maltese Falcon is  mainly credited with being the first of the film noir classics from the nineteen forties.  In it, Humphrey Bogart plays the hard-boiled   detective   who may be a little bit shady, may not always play by the rules.  Mary Astor is the femme fatale who comes looking for Sam Spade's help.   with maybe a hidden agenda.  This movie is filled with very interesting characters. Elijah Cook Junior,  who is the gunslinger muscle for  nefarious characters but isn't quite the muscle that he thinks he is. And   Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre who  may play  the first   questionable couple in   film noir history.   If you have never seen The Maltese Falcon   or seen Humphrey Bogart in any movie, this is well worth your time and effort to look into. And if you have seen it,  it's well worth picking up and seeing again.	3.786
This is my video review of The  Simpsons Movie.  If you haven't seen this movie by now  I don't really think you should. It's been out in theaters quite awhile. I'm pretty sure they'll be taking it out soon  and in my opinion, this is  pretty much just a big let down.  There  wasn't that many funny parts in the movie  and the only funny parts that there actually were I had already seen  cause they were in the commercials.  So if you own a TV and you saw the commercials, I wouldn't recommend seeing the movie, and even if you didn't see the commercials, I wouldn't really recommend the movie.  I mean, I love the Simpsons and pretty much they're always funny.  Some people don't like the current seasons, but I still think that they're pretty funny,  and I was really let down by the movie.  So  I mean the whole plot was kind of stupid. They're trying to save Springfield.   I guess I didn't like the plot so once  the plot got ruined, I really didn't care.  The movie seemed to kinda drag on for me and it wasn't even that long.  It was definitely a comedy and  I guess if you're a true Simpsons fan you're gonna wanna see the movie.  But you're probably just gonna end up wasting about six bucks. So  if you're thinking about seeing it, I wouldn't recommend it. Maybe rent it, that's probably gonna be cheaper  and if you rent it, I wouldn't really expect too much cause  really you can see a lot funnier stuff in the show, and the shows are free. So  I give the movie probably two out of five and that's being generous.	4.203
Hi, this is Brian.  I'd like to talk to you about a movie.  It's called All of Me.  It's actually kind of a short movie. It's only like ninety-one minutes long.   This is the Gold Reel Collection.  , It's kind of a slow movie. It does star Lily Tomlin, and Steve Martin.   It's interesting that Steve Martin is an an  attorney or lawyer, but he wants to be a magician,  and,  Lily Tomlin,   is a spinster and I don't want to give away too much of the plot  but she ends up being inside of   her spirit becomes inside of  Steve Martin  and that's where a lot of the interesting things in the movie come in.   It wasn't one of my favorite movies,  but  I'd probably give it a two but,  two out of five stars but ,  if you haven't seen the movie maybe you want to rent it before you you  purchase it  but you can probably get it for ten dollars because it's been out for a little bit.  Again, this is All of Me.  Thank you very much.	2.708
Hi, I'm here to review the movie The Babe  starring John Goodman.   This tells the story of Babe Ruth from his   rough beginnings as a  incorrigible little boy dumped by his parents into a Baltimore orphanage.   While he is at  orphanage, his life is pretty miserable  as the kids tease him for his body type and   the brothers   the religious order back then, believed in corporal punishment  and got away with it.   He grew up to be a  strong athlete.   Was signed by the Baltimore Orioles.   When he showed a little bit of  talent, he was sold to the Boston Red Sox, who eventually sold him to the New York Yankees.   Leading to the   one of the great curses in baseball, the curse of the Bambino. Where the Red Sox didn't win the World Series for ninety-some years.   But I find  while the story of Babe Ruth is   a a  very good story of a young man making something of himself   the portrayal by John Goodman. Babe Ruth was not a fat  pig, slob. He was a gifted athlete. He had a barrel chest and spindly legs.  We get the impression of him that he was this behemoth his entire life because most of the pictures we have of Babe Ruth are from his later years in life.   I don't like John Goodman's portrayal.	4.69
Hi, I'm here to review Otto Preminger's The Man With the Golden Arm  starring Frank Sinatra, Kim Novak and Oliver Parker.   I believe for the times, this was probably an outrageous and breakthrough movie.   Depicting heroin addictions, this movie I believe was made about nineteen fifty two, fifty three, fifty four somewhere in that time.   While it is still a powerful story,   the acting in it is way way too melodramatic,   almost to a campy or humorous   effect rather than, you know, like I said the serious story. I will say that it was probably a career stretch for Frank Sinatra to take on the role of the junkie   I mean this was at the height of his popularity with   The Bobby Soxers and   it it  was probably a a  real  gutty performance for Frank Sinatra to do this.  Like I said to me the acting is too melodramatic, but I think as   a piece of Americana film history, The Man With the Golden Arm would be worth  having in your collection.	3.873
Hi {laugh}. I'm here to review the movie The Door in the Floor starring Jeff Bridges and Kim Basinger.  This is a very disturbing melodrama about a  {sigh}  estranged couple, I guess, I mean they still live together but they are    very distant from each other. Jeff Bridges plays a children's author  and in the beginning of the movie he hires a summer intern to help him.  The young man is probably colleged age. He comes into   to try to help Jeff Bridges but  like I said Jeff Bridge's character is very bizarre and Kim Basinger's character is very bizarre.   This movie goes on to attempt to explain their weird behavior   but it is,  there are some very disturbing scenes in this movie and it is    kind of difficult to understand and  then really wonder why it was made.  I can't give The Door in the Floor  a high recommendation.	5.0
Hello Expo Tv.   I'm here today to review  the movie Michael Clayton  currently in theaters.   If you're like most people  including myself,  you probably will not enjoy this movie  because I most definitely did not.   most people would call it a law thriller.   Kind of like,  John Grisham kind of books but  Maybe more along the lines of like a two thousand page John Grisham book.   It's just,  it's far too long.  If you even look at the other  Expo TV reviews about this movie, even the people that like the movie  all seem to agree,  the movie's way too long.    The movie stars  John Grisham, I mean {laughter} the movie stars George Clooney as Michael Clayton  and   he actually, he does a pretty decent job  and  anyways, Michael Clayton  is   the fixer of the law firm,   takes care of all the  messy messy  corporate cases.  And  also  kind of complicating this is the fact that his  personal life sort of unraveling  with gambling and family problems and all sorts of things and  basically he gets to the point where  he just  gets completely sick of  fixing everyone's mistakes and it just kinda  compounds and   I don't wanna ruin it for you, but.  Hopefully you're not gonna see it anyway because it sucks.  So   I give the movie two out of five stars.  George Clooney does alright.  And  I don't know, it makes you think a little bit but most of the time  you're just thinking I wish I didn't watch this movie. So  save your money  and go see something else.  Until next time.  Peace out.	2.944
Today what I'd like to review is the movie Michael Clayton  starring George Clooney as Michael Clayton.   I'd like to state that this is Michael Clayton who is the fixer  of  court cases and not Michael Clayton the  wide receiver for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.  You go into it thinking it's a football movie   you're definitely going to be in for a little surprise. This movie I did not enjoy  whatsoever. It was extremely long and boring to me. It was like a courtroom,  a courtroom drama type movie which I definitely would not recommend,  but that's just my taste, you might enjoy it.  So basically the story is about this guy named Michael Clayton who  is a fixer and I wouldn't really say that he enjoys his job  but I definitely think he's good at it. And he's got some family problems.   He's divorced.  He's not doing so hot  cash wise  in the beginning.   This movie,  I don't know, I I  kinda  I I  started to zone out because the movie seemed like it lasted so long. I had to look it up online cause I couldn't even tell you. It said it's two and a half hours long. Honestly when you're in the theater it's going to seem like about six to eight. The movie never ends. It's like it drags on  and it's one of those movies where you really have to be thinking the whole time, so when all you're thinking about is "god when is this gonna end?" it's hard to concentrate on the movie,  which is why I got really confused towards the middle and the end.  Started off okay but I think the movie got progressively worse. I would give this movie a one out of five and unless you're into really thinking hard during movies  I wouldn't recommend it.	5.26
Hello. Today I will be reviewing the Criterion Collection edition of Silence of the Lambs.  This is probably one of the best serial killer movies ever made. It it  shows umm Jodie Foster as a FBI special agent who is   on the trail of a  serial killer named Buffalo Bill.   This is an adaptation of the Thomas Harris novel and  it's where where   one of the, the  first movies where where  we're introduced to the character of Hannibal the cannibal Lecter, who is played brilliantly by Anthony Hopkins. It's chilling just thinking about  his performance in this.   There are many special features on this. It's   it has  commentary by director Jonathon Demi and stars Jodie Foster and  Anthony Hopkins.  There are deleted scenes,  film to storyboard comparisons, FBI profiles of serial killers and many other  special features. This is rated R  and it's a little over two hours long. It's  a very well made movie  and I would recommend it to anybody who hasn't seen it  that likes serial killer movies. Again Silence of the Lambs, Criterion DVD. Thank you.	4.435
Hi, I'm Liz and I'm here to talk to you about a movie you should have already seen many times, A Christmas Story. If you haven't seen it  shame on you,  really. It's on TV  for about three weeks before Christmas nonstop.  Check it out, it's very funny.   It's a great movie because  it's funny for grownups, enjoyable for kids too, and   it's got that pink bunny suit in it, it's just fantastic.   It was written mostly by  Jean Shepherd, the great American raconteur and  directed by Bob Clark  and of course  deals with a boy who really, really, really, really just wants that Red Ryder two-hundred shot carbine action air rifle. Oh yes. But of course he'll shoot his eye out if he gets it.   There's not a lot coherency to the plot, there really isn't much of a plot, it's not the point. It's about what it's like to be a kid at Christmas time, and I think we can all sort of appreciate that cause we've all been there.   It's very funny,  very cute, enjoyable, and  if your family watched it  when you were growing up, they should have,  every year,  it'll always remind you of Christmas so  just buy it. A Christmas Story.	5.745
Hi, I'm Liz and I'm here to talk to you about Amelie.   If you've never seen a foreign movie before you're not really used to them, if you don't speak any French,   this is a great entrance into the world of  foreign films, especially French films.  But do give it your time and attention, don't try and watch it when you're half asleep  or when you're trying to pay attention to something else or do something else, because  there are subtitles that you really need to pay close attention to get what's going on at first.    And there is sort of a unique style of French filmmaking  that does come out in Amelie, although  not as much.   As some other,  some other French films. It sort of  blends in kind of seamlessly.  The thing about French film a lot of time is has this sort of surreal elements,  things that don't really seem to fit in with the, with a realistic storyline.  But Amelie's kind of a fairytale.  It has a lot of unrealistic elements anyway so it fits in nicely.    It is beautifully, beautifully photographed, the music is great, very charming.   The characters are charming, everything's well acted.  And   it's definitely something that's  a lot of fun, I think.   For  anyone, especially for people who are interested in sort of getting into foreign films but don't really know where to start.  This is a great starting place.   Probably won't feel too out of place, as different as it might be for American cinema sometimes.  So   Definitely check out Amelie as the star Audrey Tautou has been in a lot of    she's just branching out a lot more, in fact you've seen her in The Da Vinci Code.   If you've seen that.  So she's  certainly  becoming more of a,  an American,   figure  than she was before.  This is a nice place to kind of where she started out.   I I  do recommend this, I think it's, I think it's  very cute and fun  and touching and  enjoyable. Amelie.	5.0
Hi, I'm Liz and I'm here to talk to you about that Disney classic Aladdin.   It is of course  from that era when Disney could pretty do no wrong, everything was fantastic and Aladdin is no exception.   It's it's  very, very funny  and  really, really tilts more towards comedy than I think some of their other movies, some of their movies really do even the animated ones  get kind of dramatic.  And Aladdin has a little less of that, I think, and a little more of just straight up  comedy mostly because of the presence of Robin Williams as the genie of course.   And   he's, he's  really, really funny. He just is really, really, really funny.  And you've also Gilbert Godfrey as  Iago the parrot.  So you've got those, those  two, sort of   buy the attention of the audience luckily they stay  typically in separate scenes  otherwise  they would really overtake each other.  And   {cough} all of the  the songs are really beautiful  and  the animation looks great.     The plot's a little simplistic of course cuz it is at its at its  heart a kids movie but beyond that it's really enjoyable, it's got a lot of humor that's sort of  a little  a little obscure that maybe more for the for the  grownups in the audience   Aladdin really is one of those masterpieces it's very good.  And   I recommend it a lot.  Aladdin.	4.69
Hi expo TV this is Vasili and I am going to be reviewing Fred Claus.  I have to say even though I knew I was going to hate it,  I was not proven wrong I mean it was a really horrible movie.  Vince Vaughn plays  Santa Claus' Nicolas Claus' brother the  quote on quote black sheep of the family and apparently due to some saint mythology  the family and spouses of a saint do not ever die or grow old so Vince Vaughn is preserved even as it's hundred of years later he appears to be the same age and he's dating Rachel Weisz who I have no idea why she was even in the film. I though she does a lot better films than this sort of one and even though it's a horrible, holiday film I maybe this could be good but no it was bad.  The jokes weren't funny, they were really cliche,  you know a lot of elf jokes and  anyway I just don't recommend it. If you wanna go see a holiday movie,  don't see this one.	6.0
Hi, ExpoTV. This is Vasily, and I am going to be reviewing Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium. And after just seeing a horrible movie for a class, I thought, Maybe I'll go see a better movie, maybe Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium will be better. But {laugh} I have to say, it was, like, five-hundred-thousand percent worse. I have no idea what that movie was about. You know? I think it was trying to emulate Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, but it really just didn't make sense. It was just a very imaginative, very boring  movie starring Dustin Hoffman and Natalie Portman. And, you know, Natalie Portman, I like her usually. I don't know why she did this movie. And Dustin Hoffman with a lisp, you know, is not a pretty sight.  So I  don't think this movie was good for kids or adults. And I think everyone will be really, really bored. So, unfortunately, I have to give it a zero out of ten. It was the worst movie I think I've ever seen in my whole life. So  do not go see this movie.	5.745
Hi, my name is Will and this is my video opinion of the movie The Secret.   The Secret really is one of the great secrets of the universe. After I watched this movie, I did feel enlightened. I felt like there's something that I really grasped and gained from this in the overall experience from this movie really opened up my mind.   Something so simple that they reveal in this movie and different ways to obtain it, just your whole thought process, is   is literally life changing and it has been for me.   And that's what you'll see when you   when you watch this movie.  It changes your outlook on life, you know if you allow it to.   There of course, like with anything, have been some critics.   Unless you've been living under a rock for the past year, I'm sure you've you've  heard of this. It's been   featured on Oprah. It's been all over the internet, It was a book first, and   just really an excellent movie.  I I  mean excellent documentary rather, I really think you should pick it up.	5.477
Hello, my name is Andy, and this is my DVD.  Just kidding, this is Will, and this is my  video opinion of The Man on the Moon.  I thought it was good. One of the things I would have liked if they offered this in a fullscreen. A lot of things, a lot of what they're doing today is they're  converting everything over to widescreen.  Other than that I thought this was absolutely amazing. This is the movie that chronicled the life of Andy Kaufman. Of course  he played in  , you know, several, you know, several shows. He did things that were unparalleled. He did jokes that at the time were only funny to him, but jokes that are now being used today, the setups are the same thing that people are doing today. He first innovated them and they created those same ideas. And I think it's really interesting to look at, you know, his life and times.  I really enjoyed this movie.  You know I can't say enough about it without repeating myself but  you know, as you know this movie was   best actor  award for a comedy went to Jim Carrey in this year, in two-thousand when this movie came out. It was just  a excellent, a divine movie and the way it was put together.  I recommend that you go and pick this up. Again that's  Man on the Moon.	6.055
Hello my name is Sarah and I will be doing my video opinion on the movie Shall We Dance?  starring Jennifer Lopez, Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon.   You know  I really didn't enjoy this movie at all   it was,  kinda boring for me,   it kinda felt as if there were parts in there they just put in there to kinda pass the time on.   Basically the movie is about  Richard Gere's character and him being a workaholic.   He's looking for some some  extra sizzle to add into his life and  he meets up with a dance instructor who is played by Jennifer Lopez and basically she convinces him to sign up for some ballroom lessons.  He gets into it, he enjoys it a lot but he's still keeping  a secret from his family so  he is trying to cope with having this this  you know, exciting moment added to his life and trying to keep it from his family so he's trying to figure out how to balance everything and  you know I mean the dance scenes in here I felt were fantastic I thought Jennifer Lopez did a fantastic job and  the girl really can dance   as as  far as that goes, that's pretty much it. I think the movie was horrible, it was kinda boring but  if you like to see some dancing, then hey pick it up if not.  I don't recommend it.	5.354
Hi my name is Will and this is my video opinion of the movie Catwoman  starring Halle Berry.  It's a fullscreen edition  which means you get some special features including two documentaries, the many faces of Catwoman, profiles  the  evolution of the character.   You get an exciting alternative ending in the  additional scenes as well.   I thought that Catwoman was horrible.   Quite honestly I thought that the big budget  you know, film, it should have,  the,  you know, computer generated images  should have worked more seamlessly with the stunts and things like that.  I thought that it was  it relied too, too  much on the CGI.  I didn't   you know, I didn't really like the way that they made her come back to life.  I thought you know it,  you know while it did stay true to its origin, it's just when she did come back I thought her powers were a little unreal for me.   I  just you know, just didn't really enjoy it.  Her costume of course was great that was one of the highlights having Halle Berry in the movie, you know getting some eye candy.  But to me that wasn't enough to make a great film. I think that they relied too heavily on    on Halle Berry's good looks and trying to use that to make an excellent film and it just didn't work.	4.83
Nashville,  is a film by Robert Altman, released in nineteen seventy five, running time one hundred sixty minutes.  You should see this film because it is about America.  I say this because it involves, politics,  interpersonal relationships among friends and lovers,  as well as   a panorama of the Nashville music scene during the seventies   and it covers band members, managers and audience members alike,  how they are reacting and   behaving in the Nashville music scene.   This is a very very compelling film  that went on to influence the film Magnolia   which also has a similar structure with covering a lot of characters in the film  that eventually, by the end, all intersect and relate to each other and meet up some way or another.   See Nashville.	6.683
Hey guys, I'm reviewing the movie three hundred,    this is the widescreen edition,   the movie is rated R so you probably don't want to show this to your kids,   the movie's approximately a hundred-and sixteen-minutes long,   it has the same director, Frank Miller, that directed Sin City so it's a great movie.   There's lots of special features like commentary, and  yeah, this is a great action movie. It's  pretty much war all the time, it's about three hundred Spartans that go to war  with over a million people.  And I can't really say anything else, it will give it away.  But   I got this at Walmart and I'm sure you can get it at Best Buy, Circuit City,  Target, Kmart, pretty much anywhere that sells movies.   Well, yeah this is definitely a great movie, I  really would recommend it to anyone.    Yeah.   I liked it a lot, I'm sure you would if you haven't heard it, heard of it ,   you should definitely check it out. Thanks.	4.243
My name is Sarah and I will be doing my video opinion of the movie Bring It on Again.   It's the sequel to the first one,   basically I really did not like this movie at all.   I you know it was of course expected being that it was a straight to dvd movie.   I think  it was kind of corny,  you know I mean some of the the  jokes in here were  just outrageously  you know dumb for me.   It, you know I mean I guess basically if you like cheerleading and you know, it's something that you do yourself,  pick up the movie. But  you know, I, it was not my favorite at all. It was basically about   two girls going to college and joining   one of the  you know, great qualifying  cheer  teams in the country.   And basically they didn't like how things were going so they decided to start their own cheer team.  And you know, then there was a competition that they had to compete for that school because that you know, school could only have one cheer team it couldn't have two. So  they go through different things of you know, trying to start their own team   you know, doing their own routines, pretty much starting from scratch where the first form routine had already been there.      I mean I, that , you know again to me it it  was kind of boring, it just  you know, didn't really enthuse me at all.   You know I was kind of hoping for a little more excitement like the first one.   But definitely not my favorite so I really do not recommend this movie at all.	5.26
Hi, my name is Mike and I'm here to do a movie review for Thirty Days of Night, which is a moderately new   film that's still in theaters and it stars Josh Hartnett.   My wife and I saw it   believe it was two weeks ago, and   it was pretty terrible. It was not a good film,  whatsoever.   The main reason behind it was   there just really wasn't a lot of action, the colors were pretty drab.   Even though it was set in Alaska during a period  in which you get constant night,   everything just seemed to not flow really well,  the plot was kind of boring. And they really didn't do a lot with the   with the new slant on everything that they were going for, which was having the vampires be   the bad guys in this  horror movie.   Just overall the flow was awful,   the audience seemed to not enjoy really anything as well as if  me or my wife didn't enjoy anything.  Halfway through the film,   quite a few people left because they were pretty bored.  And  just overall it wasn't really enjoyable. The acting was  pretty stiff and stilted.   There was hardly any suspense, and  just overall  not a good film {noise} so.  Definitely do not go to see this movie. {noise}	5.745
Hi, my name is Mike, and this is my review for Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium and  this was a film that we took our two year old to  just a couple days ago.  It's probably one of the worst films  I've seen probably in the last five or six years.  The main reason why was there wasn't much of a plot but it was pretty boring.  Not, not  really a lot of interesting things  seemed to occur during the  during the show.   One of the things that was  kind of interesting is it seems to be a cross between Willy Wonka and  and some other Christmas style movies  in which they're just hoping to kind of show you some  interesting, colorful scenery  and have a toy store in which you walk by things and things pop out and weird stuff happens. But  that just after maybe a minute or two of that and it becomes, you become used to it, you're just really not interested in seeing any more of that.   Dustin Hoffman  is kind of bizarre  cast as this  particular person and Natalie Portman seems to just be sleepwalking through the role.   Everybody involved in this movie   seems to just be cashing a paycheck. It's a horrible, terrible film and so I I  can't  recommend it whatsoever. So definitely pass on Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium.  Save your money and rent  the classic Willy Wonka and you'll enjoy  the experience a whole lot better. And my name is Mike, that's been my movie review. Thank you.	5.745
Hey Expo. This is Jennifer, and today I'm reviewing Gladiator.  This is an epic movie about a man who was a general in an army. And the man is played by Russell Crowe who is just very macho in this movie and does an excellent job playing the role. He is a general in the army and he comes home and he finds that his village has been destroyed, his home has been destroyed, and his wife and chilled, child  killed. So he goes about to exact his revenge and instead is captured and becomes a slave. He is forced to become a gladiator for the empire, and this  is a movie about personal triumph and even though your body can be captured by someone, your spirit adheres and that it's how, it's how  you choose to live your life no matter what your circumstances are. Russell Crowe excels in this role and it just makes you  want to stand up and cheer for him when you're watching this and you see what he goes through and what he overcomes. In the back, in the sub ground there are different scenarios that are playing out with the  king and his sister and things that are going on there to watch. I don't want to give it away in case you haven't seen it. But this is definitely a movie that you can enjoy. It's a little bit long but there's a lot action and it will really just draw you in and the time will go by quickly. The DVD of course has deleted scenes and the director's commentary, always fun to see these things. And it's overall just a good movie. I'd give it five stars. Definitely fun to watch. Enjoyable and a escape from reality. So enjoy.	5.0
Hi, my name is Anaj, and today I'm reviewing the movie Saawariya which is currently running in theaters  nationwide. Now Saawariya is an Indian movie, it's actually a Bollywood production and the  nowadays  some Indian movies do show up in the US theaters.   Now about Saawariya.  I do not have good words for this movie.  I think it's like one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  Well the the  thing is that it stars this new guy who's son of the old heroes so it's kind of his  launch in, you know, home production. So it's  the story goes like, you know, there's  this new singer dancer at a bar which is in the call girl area or the red light area kind of thing and he falls in love with this girl, but this girl is in love with some other person so, you know, the story is whether he'll actually get the girl or not and, you know, how he pursues that.  The only good thing about this movie are the songs and the dances. So if you're a fan of Indian songs and the dances that go along with it you may want to watch this movie but otherwise I'll just rate this movie one out of five.   Was  bad, bad  part of New York actually, you know, going to the movies. I just lost three hours of my time for nothing.  So again this is a review of the movie Saawariya which is on theaters nationwide.	3.873
What's up Expo, this is Adam here again and I'm reviewing  Underworld. This is the widescreen special edition,  I find it to be very entertaining in widescreen, much less  than the full screen actually.  But a little bit about this movie, it has retaken the idea of vampires and  werewolves and they have them pitted against each other in a more,  in a  mortal battle.  They're fighting each other for wars on end and then this movie,  they, the main plot is about a,   is about a guy who is a descendant of one of these great, great  ancestors  and he hold the key to a more higher power within his blood. So  a little bit about that is just the,  I mean I'm not gonna reveal too much about the movie. But  Underworld it's definitely gonna get five out of five stars. This movie is full of action, intensity, I really like what they do with the vampires and the werewolves. Everyone's got their own little spinoff. This one, this one  has a good spinoff of them so you're not gonna be disappointed by that.  So Underworld, give it five out of five stars, look for the sequel Underworld Evolution. It's all good,  everything's good in this movie.  Pick it up as soon as you can. Later.	6.403
Alright so next up we've got Chicago.  Academy Award for best picture winner of two-thousand and two which it definitely should not have won. The Oscar should have gone to Gangs of New York,  Scorsese's masterpiece, or one of his masterpieces I think with  some other great movies, Taxi Driver and Goodfellas which I think a lot of people love more, but Chicago I thought was a terrible movie.  I like  I think the performers are good performers, Richard Gere and  Catherine Zeta Jones and Rene Zellweger. I find the ladies very attractive  and very talented actresses, I just didn't like them very much in this. To me this was like a made for TV  movie, they were trying too hard to try and reinvent the Hollywood musical and it just fell flat. I think the choreography a lot of very hard work went into it, but as a piece of entertainment I personally did not enjoy it.  I thought that ,  you know,   it's just overdone, dumb, silly, ridiculous. I thought the lighting was unbelievable, I thought the style was  hokey and contrived. I thought the story line was a little too   too   too much. So I give this a half a star out of five, and again I think the Oscar should have gone to Gangs of New York. But   if you like it, hey, enjoy it.	6.055
Hello, my name's Karen and I'm gonna do a review for you today of Disney's  Life-Size.  This movie is a few years old,   but my little girl still loves to watch this movie. She continually gets it   because   it's kind of like any girls little dream. It's about     like a  this movie's about a doll that comes to life.   But the  the  whole meaning of the the  movie is that   Casey, the little girl  that Lindsay Lohan plays,   she has lost her mother so it's just her and her father and of course they're having struggles   you know, trying to adjust, and then   she makes the wish one day   about her doll and then her doll does come to life.   She encounters a lot of other   things and learns a lot about herself and about her father.   It's a funny movie  this movie's eighty-nine minutes long.   It's sad, it's funny.   But it's also about   you know, having lots of fun and   about the   you know, the   the love that her father has for her.   So  I definitely recommend   Disney's  Life-Size.	2.944
Hi there Expo TV.  This is  Man On Fire,  starring Denzel Washington and and  Dakota Fanning.   This movie is rated R for language and strong violence and by strong that means extremely, extremely strong  and it is a, I think it's over two hours long, it's like  I think it's like two hours and twenty minutes.  Yeah, it was two hours and twenty-six minutes long.   basically Denzel Washington's like a burned out CIA agent that  gave up on life but then he gets  this job being a  bodyguard for  this  nine year old girl,  which is played by  Dakota and  and like and like  the girls    they like start to grow on each other  and and  they really like each other  and she gets kidnapped,  so  it's basically how Denzel  goes around  trying to find her like, not caring about what he has to do to people to get this girl  because the people that took the girl obviously, and like a crime ring like thing.  So it's just how he doesn't care if he has to,  shoot people, kill people, like , like  do whatever he can to just get this girl back.  , in this movies on TV a lot, but it's the edited version because this if very violent,  but if you want to see the whole thing I would just get the movie.   I'll give Man On Fire a five out of five so you should definitely, definitely check it out.	3.109
Hi, my name is Anaj and today I'm reviewing the movie Lions for Lambs which is currently playing in theaters nationwide. Now Lions for Lambs has a great star cast. It stars Robert Redford,  Tom Cruise, Meryl  Streep, and you know that's about it, that's the only good thing about the movie, there's nothing else that is good about this movie and I'll tell you why. So  so Tom cruise is a senator and  Meryl Streep is a   reporter from one of the newspapers or magazine or TV that I'm not very sure, but she's, she's  a reporter. So one of the scenes is going on in Tom Cruise's office where the reporter and Tom Cruise are talking to each other. The other scene is back in Afghanistan and there's a platoon of, you know, the army, the marines who are kind of  fighting, and the third is actually a philosophy professor who's talking to his student in his office. And  all the three of the, you know, all the three scenes are kind of related to each other because they're talking about why did the US go to war with Afghanistan and Iraq and what was the reason and what can be done now? And   you know whatever they talk about it's, they try to make a  drama out of it, a dramatic movie out of it, but really doesn't make sense, you know.  Everyone that I've talked to, I saw the movie I hated it. Everyone I talks to said that it did not make any sense. You know with all these star casts, these  star collectors in there, you know, that you go watch Tom Cruise in theaters  you know he hasn't been in theaters for a while now. And you see go watch his new movie and it's it's , you know,  crap. It's it's  not at all good, I'm sorry for the words but that's what the movie is. And  I rate this movie one out of five. If I had a chance of putting it zero, so you know,  it's D. If I get a chance of F I'll give a F, I'll give it a zero. But anyways I'll give it a one. Do not go in theaters to watch this movie, this  movie's no good. I mean  only if you have an additional two hours in your life that you have nothing to do go watch that movie.   Anyways this  review of the movie Lions for Lambs and my rating for this movie is one out of five.	5.745
Hey guys, today we've got Men In Black Two which is the sequel to the first Men In Black based on the   I believe it was a Dark Horse comic starring Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones.  And in the back we're playing just the opening scene when when  Will Smith is riding this   giant worm creature through the  tunnels so he can rescue the  innocent citizens of New York.  And  this movie I thought was a very inferior sequel, it was good it had some good moments,  some good elements to it.   Some of the comedy was good there was still a decent chemistry between  Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones.   Rosario Dawson shows up for her first blockbuster appearance  later on she went to star in a lot of movies by Edward Burns and in Sin City and some other movies, Alexander.  And  well overall the movie just wasn't as good, the props were just as interesting the design was just as  good.  The effects were  not quite as good I thought they could have been a bit better given the fact that it was a few years later  and that  you know ILM standards are continually evolving.  It just wasn't as funny, wasn't as entertaining.  I have to give it two stars out of five. But  if you love the first one, it is worth a look.	5.802
Hi, my name is Lindsey and I'm here today to review today for you  The Great Outdoors movie.  And this stars John Candy  and Dan Aykroyd.   It's basically about  two families that take their families   camping in a big cabin, big log cabin in the woods, and  their trials and tribulations.   It has everything, it has  my favorite things, kids getting lost,   people getting hit by lightning, a food eating contest  it doesn't get much better than that.   This is a very, very funny movie and I definitely recommend it.   It has a great story great plot.  And it also features John Candy   and I really liked all of his movies  a lot.  So I hope that you also enjoy this movie that you go out and purchase this DVD.   To add to your collection, I think that you really will like it and you won't be disappointed.  And  I also, I hope that you find this review helpful.  Enjoy.	6.403
Hello I would like to tell you about an excellent new movie  from Disney and Pixar and that's Ratatouille.   It's about a little rat named Remy  who dreams of becoming a chef.  And  I mean, but what restaurant will allow a rat  to be a chef. So  he   you know, really thinks that  he's never you know, that he's not gonna go anywhere.   But one day he finds himself  in Gusto's  restaurant.  And Gusto's is a  famous restaurant in Paris. And  there is a boy that works at  Gusto's named Linguine who can't cook at all.   So they team up together and they   try to become a you know, chef together.   Will it work out though, I mean can a rat actually be a chef.  So watch it a find out, there's some good twists and turns in there.   Brad Garrett plays the voice of Gusto.  I love Brad Garret I think he's an excellent actor.   Just,  it's, it's  a hilarious movie.  I mean you have to watch this movie it is so good the animation is excellent.   You know, Disney and Pixar although you wouldn't expect anything but excellent and you definitely get that let me show you a quick clip.  This is the kitchen of   of Gusto's.  {movie}  Really good movie you watch it you'll have lots of laughs.  I think you'll really enjoy it.  Again  it's Disney and Pixar's Ratatouille.	5.0
Hi, this is Bryan. I'd like to talk to you about a movie. It's called Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. It stars Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet. They're the main actors and actresses in this movie.  Also Elijah Woods also in there. But  it's rated R and it's an hour and forty-six minutes.   Jim Carrey's performance is excellent. He's never played a performer like this, performance like this , but he did a fantastic job in it. However I did not like the movie. I thought the movie extremely slow so I'm going to give it a one out of five stars. It took forever to get to the idea of what's going on in the movie.  It's kind a twisted movie type thing.   There's stuff about memory loss and stuff like that  this film's kind of hard to   get the idea of what's going on.  There is strong language so if you have children you may want to be concerned about that but if you don't like slow movies I would not recommend it. So again this is Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.	3.559
Hi. This is a review of Good Luck Chuck. I managed to catch this at the dollar theater at my local place.    And it's a good thing I did because it's not a very good movie.  Basically it's about  a guy who gets cursed when he's a kid by a goth girl and now every girl he meets  and gets with  will marry the next man that, that   that she meets. Or or  something, it's it's  kind of ridiculous. It's got Dane Cook as the main guy, Charlie, it's got Dan Fogler as Stu, it's got Jessica Alba as  the love interest Cam. And ,  you know, she's beautiful and everything but this is, it's  just stupid. She's just running into stuff the whole time and it's just, it's ridiculous.  Not really that funny, kind of stupid,  acting's not that great. I don't know, I just, I really didn't enjoy this movie, I thought it was dumb.   It's called Good Luck Chuck and I don't recommend seeing it.	5.26
Hi, today I'm reviewing the DVD movie Cruel Intentions.  This is  this movie is quite a few years old.  But   still have it around.  It's one of the movies that I probably liked more when I was younger, it's more gears towards like a older teenager  crowd,  probably is not appealing much to adults. It has Ryan Phillippe, Sarah Michelle Gellar,  they play  a brother and sister pair who just try to seduce everyone and they're rich.  It's just doesn't make for a   very great things to happen  it also stars Reese Witherspoon.  So   if you're a Reese Witherspoon fan then you'll like this movie.  This is one of her earlier movies definitely.   Some of the scenes in this movie are   a little unsavory,  so it's it's  definitely not a movie for kids or anything like that   definitely some of the scenes might make  you a little uncomfortable.  It also stars Selma Blair, but it's just  the classic story of rich children getting all they want and trying to seduce  other  people into their web,  so  a lot of it's far-fetched and  I probably wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for a really good wholesome savory movie.	3.742
Hi, today I am reviewing the DVD movie,  Scary Movie.   It says on the box, it's hilarious and outrageous.  I really didn't find it  that funny. I think it's geared more toward  the younger teenage, preteen audience even though it's definitely not appropriate for them.  This movie  takes   horror movies and makes spoofs on them so it's actually a comedy movie.  As you can see, it's playing here in the background  it features mostly high school kids so  hence the audience is geared towards.  I    like I said definitely do not waste your eighty-eight minutes  xxx  watching this.  There are much better movies out there. If you're looking for comedy,  then {laughter} rent or buy a comedy and if you're looking for something that's going to scare you, then I would definitely just rent or buy a horror movie because  this movie just didn't do it for me. The acting is bad.  The writing is bad and  it just looks like a  low budget film to me. I was definitely not interested at all.	5.598
Hey there, ExpoTV there.  I have the scariest movie in a decade. It's called Hostel.  It's unrated.   But if it was rated it would be rated R because it's really bad for you and bad for the kids and there's a lot of killings and a lot of blood and a lot of gore.   It's presented by Quentin Tarantino and directed by Eli Roth. So if you know them they have sick minds and they like to make sick movies.   This movie first starts off as like a x rated because you see a lot of girls who has and a lot of guys ding dongs.  So if you can get past that it's not that bad.   But the movie's about how  two Americans go backpacking through Europe and they're just trying to have a good time, but they go to this hostel and eventually they get kidnapped  and  they get tortured, tortured .  So you should see if they survive, if they die  if they bleed to death, if they get their heads chopped off, limbs chopped off, if you're into that stuff. But check it out, it's called Hostel part one, because there is a part two now.  And I would give it  a one out of five {laugh}	3.162
Hello expotv.  I'm here right now reviewing the movie currently in theaters called The Heartbreak Kid.  This movie stars Ben Stiller.   It's about this guy that marries this girl and while they're on his , while they're on their honeymoon he finds someone who he loves more, or he begins to fall in love with and so it's kind of about that.   This movie's awful.  {laugh}  It's  probably the most predictable comedy I've ever seen.  You don't you don't  have to be clever to know what's about to happen.   Most of the jokes I can put together before they were finished and it was just bad. I mean Ben Stiller is usually pretty funny. His movies aren't always, don't always have the best plot but at least  they make you laugh. And this one, I mean,  you can laugh about it being so bad but   that's about it.   Don't see this movie. It's not a good movie.   It's incredibly predictable and Carlos Mencia is in it who steals jokes. So don't see it.  Two out of five.	4.655
Hello Expo TV, I'm here to review Beowulf in three D.   This movie was a little bit disappointing to me.   After reading the book the classic, it's obviously an amazing tale.  But when you go and it's adapted to film I I  just don't think it was done as well.  The animation was excellent.   It took my eyes a few minutes to adjust to the three D at the theater I was at when   after I adjusted I thought it looked beautiful.   Especially the last fighting scene, I thought that was the best part of the movie.  But on the overall,   I was kinda disappointed. I I  thought it should have been a little bit deeper.   So if I were to go see this full price, I I  would not recommend it.   I kinda only recommend   going to see it in matinee.   I know you'll miss the 3D, but I would wait for the DVD.  Thank you.	4.359
Hello, I'm going to review a movie for you. I think I'm gonna review  the movie Napoleon Dynamite.    I'm sure you've heard of this movie, it's a cult classic that came out a couple years ago.   It is a story about  Napoleon Dynamite who is played by John Heder.   Napoleon is in high school,  kind of a dork,  well not kind of he is a dork.   But a lovable one.  He and his, he befriends the,  a Hispanic student named Pedro  and   they also have another friend  named Deb  who   they sort of hang around with and   Pedro ends up running for class president and gets the very popular and snobby  summer and    just  a story about how   you know, anybody can do what they want if they put their mind to it.  And about taking up for your friends, because  Pedro sort of   doesn't have  his his     presentation ready for the election he wasn't aware he had to have a a  skit.  And Napoleon  takes it upon himself to  put his neck on the line for Pedro and  dance. And   everybody loves it and Pedro ends up being  you know, class president and   just a really fun story. It's the the  comedy in it is not  your typical comedy, it's sort of    you know, quirky and and  fun.  And  it, Napoleon is just a great character he's   really lovable and  just a one of a kind I think. So   if you're looking for a good laugh go check this out.   This is rated PG.  I don't think there's really anything in here that that  kids can't see  not that I can remember anyway.   Teenagers of course love this movie, I'm  thirty and I love movie, thirty-one and I love this movie, so.   Go check it out and laugh and have a good time.  Thanks.	5.598
This is my review of the movie Presumed Innocent.   It stars Harrison Ford   If you've seen some of my other reviews, you know I really like Harrison Ford and have a lot of his movies.   Watch em over and over again. He's one of my top ten favorite actors.   Presumed Innocent is a thriller.  It's a mystery type story.   Harrison Ford plays a prosecutor and he's having an affair with a  coworker who's murdered and he has to try and  clear his name after he's accused of the crime and have to find out who really  did it and it's very suspenseful.   Very good, dramatic movie.   Lots of good acting.  {clears throat}   Really good story line.   Really liked it.   The movie is a long movie. It's a hundred and twenty-seven minutes long. It's rated R.   This is a older Harrison Ford movie. I don't know what year it was made but it was quite awhile ago   back in the eighties I'm pretty sure.  {clears throat} But   definitely    great for any Harrison Ford fan.   Anyone who likes  thriller  suspense type movie. It's available on Amazon dot com. It's Presumed Innocent.	4.967
Hi. This is my review of Message in a Bottle.  This is a movie starring Kevin Costner, Robin Wright Penn, and Paul Newman which was based on the best-selling Nicholas Sparks novel  also entitled Message in a Bottle.  I'm probably in the minority of people.  I know it's got a lot of good ratings and stuff when it came out, but, really, not one of my favorite movies. And  not surprising. I mean, I did watch. This was actually given to me as a gift.  But  I don't really care for Nicholas Sparks'  writing that much.  It always seems really cliche to me and  tries to be deep, but it's really not.  So I, you know, wasn't  crazy about watching this movie in the first place. And it  I mean, it was okay. I, I  watched it through. It's not like I shut it off in the middle or anything. It was worth  watching on a, you know, boring afternoon.  But  , you know, I would recommend it if you like the Nicholas Sparks books. And  also, not a huge Kevin Costner fan, so  not really up for that. I didn't find him, I did read the book before I saw the movie, and  he didn't really fit. I don't know how I saw the character exactly, but   that's just my personal opinion.   But the movie itself is one-hundred-and-thirty-one minutes long. It's a pretty long movie. And  the DVD is available on Amazon dot com, along with pretty much any DVD retail. It's Message in a Bottle.	3.559
Tonight I want to review the movie Ratatouille  I saw this the other evening  on December twelfth  and   Yes it is out on video already but there's nothing like going to the movie theater to see a movie we haven't seen Ratatouille so I took my four year old son  and  I really like Disney movies, I am a big fan of Pixar so this was right at my alley.  I wasn't too sure about what I would think of the rats  although they looked pretty cute on all the different toys and  advertisements I saw.  So  we decided to go check it out. And I did actually enjoy it very much.   It  says it's rated G on this movie ticket stuff.  I am not one-hundred percent positive about that though, there were a couple of things in there that I think could have given it a PG rating.   At the beginning of the film it starts out and   the rats are actually pretty ugly, I didn't think they would be that ugly,  I thought they would be a little more cartoony and cute looking. But  there were definitely some different parts that were pretty ugly.  Now Remy, the main rat, he was actually pretty cute most of the time and   I just, I think when all the rats were together, like hundreds and hundreds of them, they were kinda gross and grossing me out.  But towards the beginning of the film, there was a section where   there was some guns and a lady was shooting at the rats,  I didn't find that one too offensive  I do think that could have been left out and she could have been shoo , you know, shooing them with a newspaper or something.   But   you know, it wasn't horrible, but there was another scene  where  he was in Paris I believe,  and there were showing like different windows  and there was like two people, this one person pulled out a gun and like, then you heard a gunshot, I really didn't care for that and I am not sure why that was even in the film.  There's also another part of the film that   where like Remy's father takes Remy to show him what humans are like and he takes him by a store front  and the storefront sells rat poison and there are all kinds of dead rats hanging on the window and I found that incredibly gross.  But, overall, those were just the bad parts that I didn't like, there were also as I said though of the word that I didn't care for,   I didn't think it needed to be in a kids movie whatsoever.  But  anyways   Ratatouille is about  a little rat who wants to become a chef    Of course rats can't become chefs and then there's also this other guy and.  So if you watch the movie you will see what happens.  It's really cute and I definitely recommend it. It's a Disney Pixar   production and   something that  my whole family really enjoyed including my four year old. Once again  this is a movie review of Ratatouille by Disney Pixar.	4.359
Hi.  My name is Anuj and today I'm reviewing the DVD of the movie The Legend of Drunken Master.  Now this is one of my favorite movies of Jackie Chan, in fact let me try to play a scene.  And I think, yeah. This scene is, like, the best scene,  favorite scene that I like of this movie that,  he actually shows the drunken boxing. So what is done,  his step mom is passing him the bottles,  you know, of liquor, and he's kind of just drinking, getting drunk, and then he's going to show his drunken boxing.  So it's kind of funny and he, he  shows all his skills  like he does in all of the movie, but this one is, like, you know,  he has his facial expressions that he's drunk and  you know, kind of moves around a lot   while in between dancing if you can kind of see there, so  that's really cute.  And also, this movie has a lot of action scenes, you know, starting from, you know, there's a train  then in the fisher,  fish market, this one, and then there are a bunch of more that come later on in the movie, too.  And it's funny because  I think this is the only movie I saw which Jackie Chan actually gets a lot of beating house.  So, it's it's   a bunch of fun. In fact, my favorite   Jackie Chan movie.  And I'll rate this movie five out of five, I've seen it so many times and  that's the reason I got the DVD also.   It has some special features, such as  Behind the Master, which is an interview with Jackie Chan  and  you know, the bloopers in the end  always, you know, in Jackie Chan movies, there are bloopers and those bloopers are so funny, especially this one in which  he falls into the fire kind of thing, and the fire won't go away and they're just   spraying the whole thing on him again and again; it's just so funny.    Just kind of look around, look at the scene, you'll get an idea of how this movie's a little different, you know, the the  way he acts, drunk, and   drunken boxing, and,  very nice movie. Just go enjoy it.	6.055
Hi I'm Liz and I am here to talk to you about  Die Another Day. This is the twentieth James Bond film and the  fourth and final to star Pierce Brosnan in the title role,  not really the title role  but as James Bond which is as close a title role as you're gonna get.  It is available for individual purchase or as a part of  the James Bond ultimate edition volume two which is the blue one.  It also contains License to Kill,  A View To A Kill, Spy Who Loved Me and Thunderball. So if you're interesting in owning all of those,   definitely   get more for your money.   Die Another Day is a train wreck I think everyone is aware at this point,  it it  represents all the decadence of of  Western something,  I don't know it's an effing train wreck is what it is.   Horrible, horrible disaster of a movie.   They really, I think you can see the regression towards Die Another Day if you watch all the  Bond movies in order they just get more and more ridiculous and finally end up here,  with an invisible car,   an ice palace.  The problem with it is yeah Bond's always been ridiculous but at least it was enjoyable.  At least the people in it seemed to be enjoying it and this is,  goes so far off the deep end it's like everyone's just sitting there going,  when is this gonna be over.  Rosamund Pike is not that great. Halle Berry is bad, she's too good of an actress to play this kind of sleazy role she really is.   xxx in Catwoman was also very unsuccessful she should stick with you know the meaningful.    Oscar material roles and not try and descend into the underbelly   like this.    This film's unbearable,  it really is.  I can't think of another way to describe it.   You may feel differently and if you do,  I don't really know quite how to reach you.  Die Another Day is awful.  Please, please don't see it.  Ever.	5.354
Hi. Today I'm going to be telling you about a movie that I really like. It's playing in the background here. That movie: Bottle Rocket.  There's the cover.  Stars  the Wilson brothers. So there's Luke Wilson and Owen Wilson. And  Owen Wilson helped write  part of this movie and he helped write that with Wes Anderson who is the director. So  Wes Anderson has done a few other films. He did The Royal Tenenbaums and   The Life Aquatic.  So if you know anything about those movies, these are along the  along similar lines  as those movies. So  it is a comedy.   As many of Wes Anderson's movies are.   And  it is one of his earlier works so it's  not quite as clean cut as some of the newer ones. It was a little bit rough around the edges at times.   But I really like it. It's the story about these two brothers,  Owen Wilson and Luke Wilson, they play brothers in the movie.  And   the trouble that they get into trying to be successful criminals  even though they aren't very good at it.   So again I'd recommend this movie to people who like  Wes Anderson's work as  it is very similar to his other work. So in terms of the DVD, here it is again,  it retails for about fifteen dollars in most stores and there really isn't a whole lot of behind the scenes stuff  or anything about the production of the film. So if you're looking for that  I'd spend a little bit of extra time looking around, maybe look online, for a special edition  because the regular one  doesn't have, doesn't have  any behind the scenes or anything like that.  But the movie's very good. Again, Bottle Rocket. And I'd recommend it for people who are looking for a comedy film. It is very funny. So check it out.	5.802
Hi.  Today I'm going to be talking with you about a movie that I really like  it's playing in the background.  And it's this one right here, Jackie Chan The Legend of the Drunken Master.  There's also  just The Drunken Master    which is a different movie  and I think is the prequel to this, but is completely different   and is both dubbed and subtitled  throughout the movie in different ways.   well, this movie is just dubbed and is  just a little more complete in the American sense of what a movie is.  So, this is a classic Jackie Chan movie.  you've got  plenty of good fight scenes and  plenty of good action. So, I definitely recommend it to anybody who likes Jackie Chan movies or martial art films.  you're going to have plenty to watch here.   in terms of the DVD,   you can get it for about five dollars. I picked this up for five dollars.  and I think it's a great deal.  The, the  movie itself is, is  really good.  Jackie Chan has some great scenes, and  there is a lot of good action. So, I I  would say for the money I think it's worth it just for the film. There's also an interview on this DVD. And the cover looks like this.   an interview with Jackie Chan and   and that also adds a little bit of value, but I think overall for five dollars this film is worth having,  because it is so good in terms of   just it's  martial arts scenes and the action. So, if you like action movies I definitely recommend checking out Jackie Chan, Legend of the Drunken Master.	7.0
Hi today I'm reviewing the DVD movie All Dogs Go to Heaven Two.  I did not particularly enjoy the first All Dogs Go to Heaven movie, so  needless to say I was less than thrilled when my mother in law got my kids this  next All Dogs Go to Heaven movie.   My kids really didn't enjoy this one, either, and  I didn't.  Definitely.  It includes the dogs from the first movie, Charlie and Barkin. It does not include the little orphan girl from the first  movie Anne Marie.  And this movie has a little boy in it, so I guess it would be good    for  little boys to relate to this guy  more than the girl in the first one.     There's supposed to be a lot of thrills in this movie I didn't find it that thrilling and there's some villains in the movie  that kind of make it a little bit dark so I don't really think it's that great for children.    So I definitely would not recommend purchasing this movie, if you have to see it then I would  definitely recommend renting it before {laughter} you   spend the money to buy it. But  so,  I don't recommend All Dogs Go to Heaven Two.	4.435
Hi, my name is Anaj, and today I'm reviewing the DVD of the movie Screwed. Screwed stars  Norm MacDonald, Dave Chappelle, and Danny DeVito.   Well nothing much to tell about this movie that, you know,  but it's it's  bad. It's it's  not good, I mean. So they have tried to make this as a kind of cheesy comedy movie and, you know, something from the team of Saturday Night Live or something like that.  Got this DVD from a friend and  watched it. I didn't like it at all. I mean,  the jokes are kind of old.  You know, there's not much laughter. I mean you have to kind of make yourself laugh if you have to but there's they have build up a story, it's a little dramatic but  most of it is old and there's nothing not a new idea in there.  But this DVD has some special features that come along with this movie. There's  like the production notes, the cast and the filmmakers, and the theatrical trailers. So in fact  believe me I preferred the trailers over the movie, that's how bad I  you know I thought this movie was. Didn't like it at all. That's my personal opinion, I'll rate this movie one on five and it's crude  and , you know, you can see the scenes behind and kind of get an idea how the movie goes.	5.745
Hi. I'm Liz and I'm here to talk to you about Kingpin which is from the guys who brought There's Something About Mary and Dumb and Dumber according to the back of the DVD case which should give you some indication about  what kind of movie this is.  It stars Woody Harrelson, Randy Quaid, and Vanessa Angel, whoever she is.   I saw the trailer for Kingpin many years ago, it was attached to some  DVD that I watched pretty often and every time I saw it I thought "man that movie looks so stupid". And then  I saw that  my boyfriend owned it and he said "oh you should give it, you should give it a shot. It's   it's a lot funnier than the trailer cause in the trailer they couldn't use a lot of the, you know, more raunchy humor" and it's like okay, fine, you know. I'll give it a chance. When will I learn to trust my instincts?  I don't know.  Anyway  Kingpin I I  didn't think was particularly funny. It has a few sort of chuckle moments with kind an aww ending, but other than that  no way. Kingpin's not funny to me at all. And  granted it is a kind of  There's Something About Mary, American Pie  style of humor that has never appealed to me really   and it's not that it's vulgar because I don't mind that at all, it's that that is what is supposed to be funny about it. If it was a movie like Superbad  which came out recently, very, very funny and it's incredibly vulgar but that's not the basis of the humor. The basis of the humor is the delivery of the line and how people sort of interact with each other.  And there's just so much  more realism to it and more heart to it and this is just bleh.  I don't know.  Bill Murray is in it,  that might be why. I've never really liked a movie with Bill Murray in it  that I can recall and  it's not that I have anything against him, I just have never liked him. And maybe he ruined it for me.   Anyway   to talk really more in detail about this movie Woody Harrelson is a pro bowler who loses his hand, can't bowl anymore, finds a   naive Amish guy who can bowl really well and his plan is to win some prize money for a bowling tournament using this   this Amish fellow. And of course everyone learns a valuable lesson about not using people or whatever, I don't know. I just don't like this movie and  I'm sick of talking about it so quite frankly if this kind of movie is your style,   if this is the kind of movie you like and you know if it is then I'm sure you'll love this movie. If you're not a big fan of this type of movie don't even bother. It's not any better than any of the others and  you'll find it quite dull and unfunny. So that's my personal opinion on  Kingpin.	4.359
Corbin here, reviewing the movie The Punisher, the punisher is   a movie based on like a Marvel comic book, and it's about a vigilante  who doesn't care about you know,  the law  and he  first starts out   his family gets murdered by, like some crime lords, you know type mafia,  and he basically takes revenge   because of them. And starts becoming the punisher.    John Travolta is in this as one of the bad guys, he does a pretty good job.   But in all honesty this is probably an average movie if you ask me.   It's an average superhero movie, and it's a average crime kind of movie.  There's a lot of action in it and it is rated R due to violence and language and things like that.  But  in all honesty it's just pretty average if you ask me.   There are quite a bit of special features, including  in depth look at the stunts,  the origins of the punisher on the set music video sneak peek,   an interview with the cover artists, and audio commentary and deleted scenes.  And I actually think they're working on a second movie   as we speak, with a different  person as the punisher because he couldn't  do the movie because of a prior engagement.  But  overall, I guess if you're a huge fan of the punisher or these types of movies, you should at least rent it.  The Punisher.	4.082
Hi. Today on ExpoTv I'm going to be reviewing  a new movie that is a French movie and it's called  Smiley Face. And Smiley face is  kind of the same   genre of movies as   you know the Cheech and Chong movies, and  Half Baked, Grandma's Boy, that kind of like stoner movie. And but this one is just not even really that funny and really even that good at all.   Basically  the plot of the movie is this    pothead named Jane eats  these these     treats that are, that have THC in them and she doesn't know that she does it and it just follows her day  and her hilarious, supposed to be hilarious, misadventures and mishaps. But  it's not funny   it's really really just a bad movie and   if you want to see a good stoner movie see Half Baked,  it's really funny. Or Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle. Don't see this one, just skip it. It's not worth your money, and   just don't go to see it. It's called Smiley Face and avoid it at all cost.	5.686
Hey this is Dan with a review of The Simpsons the Movie.   I have been an avid fan of The Simpsons most of my life, and   was quite disappointed  that the movie wasn't anything more spectacular than in an overblown episode per se.   The Simpsons the Movie basically    it serves on the premise of   basically  the entire town   being at the verge of a toxic waste dump and ready to be quarantined.   When things happen that makes it such,   the national government  steps in  and tries to seal it off in a  bubble of sorts.    The premise isn't anything too far fetched out of a  wacky Simpsons episode,  and the postmodern   references within it to   movies like Titanic  and   other references or nothing more  than something you might expect from a halloween special to The Shining or something like that.  So there was nothing too novel about it, I didn't find it particularly funny, particularly interesting and definitely not worth a ticket price   let alone probably wanting to purchase this movie unless you get it  at a really good deal.   It is a overblown episode,  would not highly recommend it out of five,  out of four stars I would probably give this two.    Out of five it's definitely two.  But The Simpsons The Movie  not worthwhile in my book.  It has cooler  animation  stressing more three D at the perspectives but  nothing too revolutionary, so  with that,  The Simpsons the Movie,   not something I'd really keep in my collection  unless you can get it  for a pretty good deal  despite the donuts.  This is the end of my review of  The Simpsons the Movie.	4.83
Hi expotv. My name's Lindsay and I'm here today to talk to you about the DVD movie Stuck on You. This stars Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear as   conjoined twins  who are combined, who are adjoined I guess at the liver. Therefore they cannot be separate because they need their liver to survive.   This movie is made by the Farrelly brothers, who also made There's Something About Mary and all I have to say if you like There's Something About Mary you will hate this movie. It is stupid, ridiculous, slapstick, like really cheesy, cheesy  lines that they think they're funny and I don't think they're funny. So I really can't recommend this movie {laugh}  but on the DVD it has  a audio comedy by the Farrelly brothers,  has deleted scenes, a bloopers reel,  a theatrical teaser and trailer, things like that.  But  I don't like this movie  but you can check it out  anywhere you buy DVDs. Again it's Stuck on You, the DVD movie starring Greg Kinnear and Matt Damon. I hope you find this review enjoyable and helpful.	6.403
Hi. I am Chris and this is a review of the DVD, The Last Castle starring Robert Redford and James Gandolfini.   In this movie, Robert Redford plays a   military general sent to   prison for a crime, sort of a technicality of a crime  but he is sent to a military prison and the warden of the prison is  James Gandolfini, best known for his role in the sopranos.  And once there, Robert Redford finds that the prison is hopelessly corrupt and some of the inmates are being murdered and   James Gandolfini's character, the warden,  is running the prison   like a despot and  there's just a whole bunch of bad things  going on inside the prison that shouldn't be happening.   Robert Redford decides to do something about it and  takes command and runs the military prison as sort of a military camp.   This movie starts out okay but quickly devolves,   it doesn't end up being very good. I am not exactly sure  what Robert Redford is doing in this movie.   I feel maybe he lost a bet   towards the end of this movie, it just becomes  silly. The ending was a little bit surprising but by then I I  really didn't care anymore.   This movie, it doesn't turn out to be as good as it starts out.  It's a fairly  promising premise at the beginning but the  execution was just poor   and it can't make up it's mind if it's  a prison story or a action movie or  exactly or military inquest  type of a conspiracy movie.  It just can't make up it's mind what it is and falls apart in every level and  by the end, you're just not interested anymore.   As far as the DVD itself goes, special features  on this includes pretty standard theatrical trailer, production notes, deleted scenes, commentary and   a little HBO movie called  Inside The Castle Walls  about military prisons and things like that.  Really  it's not, it's not worth your time.  Maybe if it's on TV, you might watch it then, but really, I wouldn't bother with The Last Castle on DVD.  Thanks.	6.351
Hi, this is Nicky.  This is my review on the movie  Dazed and Confused.  This is the flashback edition, edition  which is   the digitally remastered pictures.   With  surround sound.    There's also nine never before seen    deleted scenes.  And  this is about an hour and forty-three minutes long,  and it's rated R for   drug usage  and language  and  just crude humor.    This is a very funny movie  because  it's it's  based on the last day of school in nineteen seventy six.  Which kind of takes me back {laugh}   so without giving away my age,   this is a really great movie, very funny,  and  and if you are  in your late twenties    early thirties,   this will,  even your late thirties, this will  definitely bring back some memories, so.  Check it out, Dazed and Confused.	3.559
Hey Expo TV I've got a review today for you guys and it's on the movie Borat.   It's a hilarious movie.  It  stars Sacha Baron Cohen. You might also know him  as Ali G.    and it's his character  he plays a a  reporter from the country Kazakhstan  and it's his journey to the United States   to just check out the country and then   when he gets here he finds Pamela Anderson, or he sees her and then he tries to hunt her down because he thinks she's like a super babe so, he like hunts after her and it's completely  false. It's not a true story, but it's filmed kind of like reality and it's absolutely hilarious.   It's very vulgar.   It's rated R.  But if it could be rated like forty-five, that's what I would give it because it's really bad and vulgar  and disgusting at times but it's really funny and I laughed a whole lot.   Some people don't find it funny because it's kind of dirty and stuff but I love it.  So I definitely give it a five out of five stars for   Borat  the movie.  Peep it.	5.066
Hey ExpoTV, my name is Austin.  And behind me, playing, the television screen, is the movie Napoleon Dynamite.  There's the man himself. This film, is, completely pointless.  There's no plot.  The first time I watched it, I didn't find it humorous at all. But,  I thought it was pretty funny the second time I watched it. Napoleon is basically a dorky dude.  Not him, him.  Complete dork and then he runs for , or helps his friend run for president, Pedro.  And , like I said there's no real point to it. It's just him being an idiot and a dork and it's pretty funny.  So , if it made me laugh, so of course I gotta give it a five out of five stars.  So, Napoleon Dynamite five out of five stars.	2.16
This is the one and only Akira. This edition here is the limited edition tin version of Akira.  If you can find this, I highly suggest getting your hands on it. It's going to cost a little bit of money, but I promise you, in a few years, in a number of years after that, it will pay you right back. You try and sell it on eBay, it's going to be double, triple its worth.  Here it is playing on the television screen here. It's an early  scene.  This film revolutionized anime. It mainstreamed it enough so that the West and America would accept it.  It was the first time that a a  Japanese animated film didn't cut corners by having a static body and only the lips moving. It was they they  animated every single portion of the body, every single portion of the environment was moving, the entire screen was alive. It was very realistic.  Akira was probably eight years ahead of its time, with animation style, graphics, and everything. It was just brilliant. I really suggest you going out there and getting it. If you're an anime fan, you know how good this movie is. And this edition will be a great, great  edition to your collection of anime. So good luck, if you can find it.	6.055
Hello expo. I'm here to review Alien Versus Predator: Requiem.   I went to this movie and I was greatly disappointed  but maybe I shouldn't have been at this point cause I shouldn't have expected much from it.   The movie was a classic Alien Versus Predator.   It's pretty much the story of  a ship crashing, a predator ship crashing, from the  last one. Crashes on earth in a small town and aliens get loose and start killing all the inhabitants.  So a Predator has to come and save and hunt these aliens.     So I mean if that's what you're after, if you're all after is is  a Predator killing aliens then fine. The bad part is there's only one Predator, which kind of sucks. So you didn't get to see a bunch of different cool things like in the others.   Definitely gets tireless after a while {laugh}. Don't expect much in in  acting or anything like that, it's pretty much just classic Alien Versus Predators.   I would recommend waiting  for a movie.  I don't think you should go see this in theater or even pay matinee for this. Just wait for a movie to come out and enjoy it then. Thank you.	4.32
Hello everyone.  Playing over my shoulder right now is this,  The Shawshank Redemption starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.   It was  based on   a work written by  Stephen King  and it was adapted by  Frank Darabont and he also  directed the movie.    Tim Robbins stars as a  man who is wrongfully imprisoned for the murder of his wife,  and   he gets sent to   Shawshank Penitentiary,  and  he  befriends some of the other inmates and   tremendously affects their lives in a positive way.  And  it's a really, really good movie it's  one of my favorites.   Morgan Freeman is great in this movie,  and  so is Tim Robbins.  And   it's very well directed and well written and it's it's ,   funny and it's  interesting and it's got a really positive message.   The dvd  here  doesn't come with any kind of  special features,  if that's your thing.  The only thing that's on it is like a theatrical trailer.  But   it's  it's, it's   one of my favorite movies, there is, there is a reason why it's  number two on the, on the internet movie database's top two hundred and fifty movies.    Lot of people really like this movie because it's really, really good.  And   I really can't recommend it enough.	6.0
Hello everyone.  This movie is Fargo   on DVD. It was written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen,  who also made The Big Lebowski and  O Brother Art Thou and currently No Country for Old Men, which is in theaters right now.  Those are all really good movies and this is probably their best movie.   It came out in nineteen ninety-six and  they won an academy award for the screenplay and Frances McDormand, who stars as a  pregnant police detective,   she also won  best actress for performance in this movie.    It's really tense and  there's   sudden burst of violence  but it also has a really, really good sense of humor that never feels out of place or unusual. It's rooted in   the characterizations  and the people going on and how they say things and just their overall perspective on  life and things.  And   it's a really smart,  funny, well constructed thriller and there's some moments of just genuine tension where you are like, oh man, oh oh no, you know, tension so  the DVD doesn't really   come with anything  interesting, there's a better edition of it out that has a commentary track by the same photographer of the movie  this edition only comes with   a theatrical trailer   but also comes with the  full frame version and the  letterbox version of the movie which is playing over my shoulder  right now.   The scene that's playing over my shoulder right now is   the two guys who are  hired by William H. Macy's character who is really, really good in this movie.    He hires these two guys, one of which is played by Steve Buscemi to kidnap his wife so he can   get some  ransom money   off of  his  father-in-law.  And because he has some financial problem and  everything just,  just snowballs and just goes straight downhill as fast as you can possibly imagine.   But it's a really well directed movie and   it's very tense and funny and I cannot recommend it highly enough.	6.055
Fred Claus,  a current movie  in theaters, is about Santa Claus's older brother, Fred Claus, who is  forced to move to the north pole. A movie kind of suitable for Christmas and families, but   ultimately falls flat because  Fred Claus just  isn't a really good movie.   The actors  many of you may know. It's kind of like,  a good set of actors but an awful script, bad directing,  and  the,  the story is nothing to really talk about.   The,  it's basically a comedy, right? And when you go to see a comedy you expect to laugh, you expect to have a good time,  and although Fred Claus is very silly and you shouldn't go in expecting much, it's really not funny.   So I guess I would recommend this only to people  who have families that they like to go see it with, and  have a decent time. But there's a lot of other comedies out there, even if they're not suited for  teenagers and  people in their twenties and thirties.  Fred Claus is a movie I definitely do not recommend, unless you're taking children to see it, and  with such actors you wouldn't imagine having such a bad script and  directing and  everything like that. Fred Claus.  Definitely not recommended.	2.38
This is Fantastic Four,  the first one. It's playing here in the screen.  What can I say about this?  It stars Jessica Alba and  though she may be pretty,  she's not the best actress.  The movie is just really not that great.   The acting in it is mediocre. The special effects in it is  the same  and so is the script and story. All of it's mediocre. The direction was was  horrible.  I was completely  unsatisfied by this movie.   There's not much else to say besides that.  But  the story was so bad that I actually considered leaving  halfway through the movie. So, don't go out there and get this movie please, because it's really not worth it. If you wanna see a good superhero, if you wanna see a good superhero movie, go see any of the Spider-Mans,  go see any of the go see Batman Begins, that's a good one, or go see any of the X-Men.  Those are all great movies. This movie just jumped on the superhero bandwagon and just did not do a good job at retelling the true story of the Fantastic Four  group.  It just didn't do it any honor.  I would be ashamed  to have made this film if I was a director. So I don't suggest you go out there to watch it and waste your money on this DVD. Thanks.	4.796
Meet the Parents  that's what's playing on the TV here.  This is the bonus  edition of Meet the Parents.  Now what can I say about Meet the Parents?  It's hilarious.  Robert De Niro's in it. Ben Stiller's in it  and throughout the whole entire movie they just butt heads constantly. Ben Stiller gets into  trouble and trouble and trouble after trouble. He just can't stop and it's just  though unrealistic, it's just hilarious to watch and laugh.  So I know anybody who's a fan of laughing, which should be everybody, you guys will love this. Here, as you can see, is the infamous lie detector scene.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, don't worry about it, cause I didn't ruin anything. Neither does this, because it's all muted anyways.  But yeah, it's a great date movie. It's a great  family movie.   I think it's it's  rated PG-thirteen, so not for the very young but  the old enough.   So, highly suggesting Meet the Parents bonus edition.  Thanks.	5.033
This is Frank Miller's extended recut unrated edition of Sin City.  Here it is starting to queue up on the television here. It's got tons of stars in it: Bruce Willis, Josh Hartnett, Jessica Alba, and all of it was filmed  on a green screen. The entire film is a special effect which is pretty interesting.  It's a revolutionary filming tactic.  Three-Hundred used it, but before that was this. It comes with two discs, special features and the feature presentation. And it also comes with one extra special  thing and that is a  pretty thick graphic novel. It's pretty interesting to read. The film I really enjoyed. It's very fast paced, edgy, a lot of action.  If you're looking for a very deep story this probably isn't the film for you, but if you're looking for a lot of great action sequences and really cool special effects this film is definitely for you. Very gory however, so not for the young children. Definitely for the adults only, definitely. But if that's what you're into I definitely suggest going out there and getting this  set because it's a great collection to have in your DVDs. Thanks.	5.0
This is the Nicholas Cage film Windtalkers directed by John Woo.  Here's a clip, clip playing on the television screen.  , I'm going to have to say do not get this movie.  Do not go out there and watch it.  It's just no good.  Usually I'm a big Nicholas Cage fan but this time he completely missed his mark.  But I feel like it was John Woo to blame.  John Woo does martial arts. He does not do war films.  And martial arts  really like to emphasize  dramatic scenes every single second. You know what I mean, like throwing a, throwing a  suitcase across the grounds very dramatic. Running across the room is very dramatic when everyone is shooting at you.  But, war movies are supposed to be as a whole dramatic.  But he tries to make every single little tidbit of it very dramatic and very it becomes very awkward.  Nicholas Cage does his best, but he can't just pull it off.   There's a scene where they mix actual real life cannon firing video with filmed video, and it's just very awkward to watch.  I didn't enjoy it at all.  The musical score was no good.  A lot of the movie is just more awkward than it is entertaining. So I don't suggest going out there and finding Windtalkers.  Save yourself the money, get yourself another Nicholas Cage movie.  I don't know, like Face-Off.  That's a good John Woo, Nicholas Cage movie.  Watch that.	6.055
Tonight I want to review this  DVD movie by  Disney Pixar. It's called Ratatouille.  It's a relatively new movie and  it's one of   Disney's better successes.  We took our son to see this before we purchased the DVD and I ended up purchasing the DVD because it was such a great movie.  The plot is this little rat that   not like the other rats, he doesn't like to eat garbage. And he's thinking, you know, why eat garbage when you can just go in the kitchen and get the good stuff? So in the meantime he's doing all this he develops this fondness for, {chuckle} you know,  fine foods and cooking cause he's watching this   chef on TV in this old lady's house as he's  yeah there he goes looking at him now. Gustav. And  it's really a great movie. I really enjoyed it. A lot of the kid's movie I can sit through and just kind of grin and bear it but I really enjoyed watching this movie. I love the animation.  Pixar does such a great job and combined with Disney's  storytelling you can't beat this.  It's rated  G, general audience, so I highly recommend this movie.	5.686
Hi Expo TV, this is Melissa. You can  check out my profile at PM three two one. I'm here today to review for you the movie Mallrats, directed by Kevin Smith.  {clears throat}  This is, you know, got the classic Jay and Silent Bob duo in here, Jason Lee.   Shannen Doherty,  Basically there's just a bunch of guys, they just hang out at the mall of the time.  as it says on the front of the  DVD, they're not there to shop, they're not there to work, they're just there. And that's basically what they do, they just hang out at the mall all the time. They're mallrats.   We do have some good special features. We have feature commentary with the director Kevin Smith, cast members Ben Affleck, Jason Lee, Jason Muse, producer Scott Mosier, and Vincent   and I can't pronounce his last name, I'm sorry.  over an hour of deleted scenes, live footage from the feature commentary  session, featurettes, theatrical trailers,   soundtrack presentation,   by the Goofs Build Me Up Buttercup and production photographs.  once again {clears throat}  I'm not really into this  type of   genre, I guess   my husband was helping me out and he said, if you give this one a bad review I don't know what to say and I was like well, I didn't say anything, but I'm definitely giving it like a two out of five. Definitely not my cup of tea, but if you like that  genre then you're gonna like it. Thank you.	3.559
Hi expo TV. This is Melisa and you can check out my profile at pm three two one to see my reviews.  I am reviewing for you today Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.  {cough} You have Indiana Jones who's played by Harrison Ford and you have  a great actor that also joins the cast for this one, Shawn Connery who plays  Indiana Jones' father.   once again totally action pack, suspenseful,  right on the edge of your seat type movie   is written by George Lucas, directed by Steven Spielberg   the musical scored by Jack Williams again just a  great lineup of everybody involved in this movie from top all the way to the bottom   not a lot of special features but as I said before, if you grab the whole  box set you get an extra DVD just on bonus features so that's something you might want to  look into instead of buying them individually   {cough} this is a movie if you haven't seen it or if you haven't seen it in a while,  definitely take an afternoon and evening,   grab a bucket of popcorn and just hang out for the whole family to watch because it's something that everybody is going to enjoy and I hope you like it.	5.26
Hi Expo TV, this is Melissa and you can check out my reviews at PM three two one  to see , what I've been reviewing lately.  I'm reviewing for you today, The Matrix, featuring Keanu Reeves and Lawrence Fish, Fishburn .  Basically, this movie, changed , the way movies are made now.  , they just came out with these innovative new ways to film  that just changed the whole film industry, and a lot of movies have started to film  like the way they did The Matrix.   There's some good special features on this , DVD.  You have behind-the-scenes documentaries, cast and crew commentary, music only audio track,  follow the white rabbit and take the red pills for more mysteries, mind bending extras.   We also have interactive menus, filmographies,   scene access, English subtitles, and more.   basically this is what it says on the back here and ,  I was trying to think of a way to describe this movie because it's just so complex,  and the way they put it on the back just ,  it's the right way to say it.  , Our perception is our day in and day out world is real.  And the reality is the world is a hoax and elaborate  decept,   deception spun by an all power, spun by all powerful machines of artificial intelligence that control us.   This,  movie really makes you think, what if there is more  to what our world really is, and it's just a fabulous movie if you haven't seen it you definitely have to watch it.  I give it a five out of five,  and it's something you need to check out.  Thanks.	4.83
Hi, this is Dan with a review of The Golden Compass, available in theaters nationwide. The Golden Compass in my opinion was a turkey. Absolutely thought it was terrible.  Partially probably because I never read the book.  But even so  if you've seen The Chronicles of Narnia think of The Golden  Compass providing the action that Chronicles of Narnia missed but none of the story line.  The Golden Compass spent so much time trying to  lucidly  portray and introduce new characters that there was really never any character development, nor do you really get a sense of what was going on.   Basically you have a little girl who ends up going to the north in this fantasy world with friends Iorek,  which is a ice bear,  played by a  Ian McKellen's voice and  runs into  unraveling  secrets of her past and of her future as she meets a variety of different people.  Unfortunately after she meets all this a brief scuffle occurs and the movie ends all too quickly.  For example one of the star features in there, who you know, I thought was  one of the main leads in the movie doesn't even show up for most of the movie, and that would be our friend   Daniel Craig,  better known as the new James Bond   who plays a  major character in this movie.  Oh wait, in the next movie in this installment. So it was a big downer, especially since I did not realize, you know, this was the beginning of  a blockbuster  hit that was supposed to  go into effect. Well blockbuster it was not.  Not recommended. We'll see if they continue this terrible series. Would not recommend seeing The Golden Compass in theaters this season. This is Dan with my review of The Golden Compass.	6.055
Hi, tonight I'm reviewing The Ice Harvest  starring Billy Bob Thornton and John Cusack.   This movie is  kind of a crime  spoof,   for lack of a better word. I  guess you could say a comedic gangster movie.   Essentially you have John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton who pair up to actually steal money   from a crime boss played by Randy Randy  Quaid, who actually does a really good job providing some comedic relief  to this one.   When they steal the money  {clears throat} excuse me,  they have to go through and do   go through the night and  cross all kinds of stuff.   Parts of it are really really farfetched. Parts of it are  bust your gut funny though.   But it's only small parts. Pretty much what they showed in the previews that looked funny, that's what's gonna be funny in this video.   So not a lot above that.   It does have an alternate ending in the bonus features.   I don't know that it makes it any better though.   But take a look at that  alternate ending. Also some outtakes from Billy Bob Thornton, some director's commentary, bloopers,   things like that.   So if I had to recommend this one I would probably stay away from it just because  it's  blah. There's nothing to it.   So I would probably not recommend this one. Thanks.	6.055
Hello. Today I'm reviewing Flight of the Phoenix, starring Dennis Quaid,  Tyrese Gibson, and  Giovanni Ribisi.  This movie also has Hugh Laurie in it  before he became House and really became famous.  So it's interesting to see him in some of these old roles.  This movie  at at  its core is about  a cargo plane with some mismatched passengers on it. It's flying over a desert,  runs into a storm and crashes.  So the survivors that are left are all stranded in this desert and they're trying to find  a way to get out.   The way it ends and the story line of it altogether is really, really, really farfetched. You really have to buy into  movie magic to go along with this one.  Dennis Quaid  he used to be a really good actor, all of a sudden it seems like every single movie he's in he has the same exact expressions on his face  so I'm not sure what's going on there but I'm definitely getting tired of seeing his scowl.   Movie not all that great, like I said really, really farfetched.  When you see the ending, if you ever see the ending,  you will probably think it's the stupidest thing you've ever seen before because  it's it's  really over the top the way they ended this one. A few   bonus features on this one.  Some director's commentary, some  deleted and/or extended scenes,  and some making of the movie documentary diary type  entries. So as far as this one goes I would say definitely  leave it on the shelf. I probably wouldn't even waste my time to  to watch it. This one was definitely a disappointment for me. One out of five stars.	7.0
Hello, today I'm reviewing The Exorcism of Emily Rose  starring Laura Linney.  This movie is supposed to be based on a true story.   The previews for it looked really really really good,  but it was not quite what I expected.  I expected something more along the lines of an The  Exorcist  where it actually shows the story of the girl and the priest coming in and and performing the exorcism and going through it step by step like that and that just doesn't happen in this movie.  This is actually told  from the point of view of a priest who  performed the exorcism on Emily Rose. And  it starts at his trial. He's on trial for  completing that exorcism and the only time you get to see Emily Rose is actually through flashbacks or through his storytelling.  The parts where you actually get to see her and what she's going through  with demons possessing her are great.  If the whole movie would've been like that this definitely would've been, you know, one of my top movies of all-time because the part where it's focusing on her is well acted. The girl in this movie did a really really good job. You do feel like she's being tormented  but there just was not enough of it to support the movie.  There are some haunting special features on this one  some commentary, some deleted scenes  and some other featurettes.  If I had to rate this one I would say probably leave it alone. It's gonna get a one out of five from me.   Just not enough of the actual exorcism  to make it worth viewing. So that's gonna be my judgement on this one.	5.477
Hello, I'm reviewing the movie The Missing  starring Tommy Lee Jones and Cate Blanchett.   This is another Ron Howard film.   It's supposes, supposed  to be a suspense movie.   Essentially what happens is   Cate Blanchett   is living on the prairie and   someone or something comes in and captures her daughter. Kidnaps one of the two girls and takes off with her  and Tommy Lee Jones is actually Cate Blanchett's father. He shows up   to help find the girl. He's an indian tracker   so he has the ability   to help find the girl.   I gotta say I honestly didn't get this one. I didn't think Tommy Lee Jones   pulled off this role at all.   Thought Cate Blanchett did a great, did a good job.   But nothing really great.   Didn't get it. Didn't understand it. As far as it being a Ron Howard film I was actually fairly disappointed.   This particular version actually comes  with the first disc which has the movie on it and then you have the second disc that has a whole lot of   bonus features. Actually   three alternate endings. Maybe if they would've picked another one it would've been been better.   Eleven deleted scenes and eleven behind the scenes featurettes   and a lot of other stuff as well. So  I would not recommend this one,  even with all the bonus footage.   This is just not my kind of movie.	3.873
Hello, today I'm reviewing the movie  Showtime,  starring Robert Deniro and Eddie Murphy.  , I gotta say that when I heard Robert Deniro and Eddie Murphy I actually thought it was going to be the funny,  one of the funniest things I've ever seen before  and it just didn't work.  , I don't like this movie.   Essentially the premise of it is, , Robert Deniro is a,  you know, a cop, defined by what you see on television, I mean, just a man's man.  He goes out and he, you know, he does what he's supposed to do by the rules. I, he's kind of bully, bullied  into ,  participating in a  reality show.  And he's not happy about that, so cameras are following him around night and day, .  On the opposite end of the spectrum you have  Eddie Murphy's character who's kind of, arrogant, and all about being on TV,   ready for his time in the spotlight.  And , the chemistry between the two as friends just didn't come off.  , Not very funny at all.  A couple of one liners here and there.   But I definitely didn't think it was one of the funniest things I've ever seen.  I thought, you know, worth watching, maybe once, and then that was it.   As far as bonus foot, footage , there is actually some behind-the-scenes footage on here.   The HBO first-look at this movie,   some deleted scenes, some extended scenes, and even a blooper real, but even those things really don't help this movie out.  So, for me, this one's only gonna pull a one out of five stars.  If you can see it for free, I'd see it for free. If you have to pay to see it,  I'm gonna say leave this one alone.	5.196
Hello, today I'm reviewing the movie Vanity Fair  starring Reese Witherspoon.  This movie is a Focus Features release which means it's an independent film   and you can really tell this is an indie film.  It may just be me but I didn't get this one.  I love Reese Witherspoon. I think, you know, she does a great job in acting. Love Sweet Home Alabama,   all those movies.  This one was kind of horrible for me. Essentially she plays a girl who is poor. She's down and out on her luck and decides to lie and cheat her way into another English class during the eighteen-hundreds.   Of course, you know, along the way she ends up meeting a guy and things, you know, one thing leads to another and   that gets in the way of what she's trying to do.  so  really the basic story that's already been told. We've seen it before.  It's just she did not pull this role off.  The movie, I didn't like the writing, I didn't like the premise behind it.   Definite only a one out of five stars for me.     Few special features on this one.  A look at the women behind Vanity Fair.  Some director's commentary, some deleted scenes and even a behind the scenes look at the movie.  But even those bonus features aren't going to make it any better. We're looking at one out of five stars on this one. Thanks.	6.055
The movie that I am reviewing and what's playing on my screen right now is called Mystery Alaska,  and it's about a group of hockey players from a small town in Alaska called Mystery,  where their favorite thing to do is every Saturday play a game of hockey.   The hockey teams are actually voted on by a council, and this, the whole town   revolves around hockey,   until one day, when the Sports Illustrated writers come and review this team  and say they they  rival any team in the National Hockey League.  Well, of course the NHL gets wind of that, and they send down the New York Rangers to come and test this team out.    The town builds a rink, an arena, everything to play this game.  It's got a lot of comedy, a lot of drama,   a lot of action, actually. It's a sports movie, obviously, but it's awesome.  Every hockey fan I know has this in their DVD collection.  Now it's rated R and it has a running time of one-hundred-nineteen minutes, so it may not be one you wanna watch with your children,  but it's an excellent, excellent movie, and I definitely recommend it.	7.0
Hi my name is Dottie and today I'm doing a video review for expo tv.   Rob Zombie's Halloween.  This is the unrated directives, director's  cut edition.   We saw this movie back when it was released  in two thousand seven at the movie theaters.  And once we saw the movie we knew that we would have to get the movie on dvd when it was released because it was such a good movie we thought.   This  particular Halloween  Rob Zombie   shows  young Michael Myers, his childhood.  Why he possibly became the   madman that he did.   It  also showed  the time that  Michael Myers spends in the insane asylum.   Once he escapes,   it's basically  a retold story of the original Halloween.   Basically the same,  but it has, does have some different  things that were not in the original Halloween   the one that was done by John Carpenter.   This movie actually is rated, is an unrated version,  so definitely no kids in the room.   There is a lot of  vulgar language,  nudity.  It can possibly make an adult   feel a little bit     shy about watching.   But overall it's a really good movie I do recommend it.  And I am hoping that Rob Zombie does   a sequel to this movie.  I want to thank you for taking a look at my video review  for Rob Zombie's  Halloween.  The Uncut  Director's  Version.  Thank you.	3.416
Hi, I'm Liz and I'm here to talk about Manos: The Hands of Fate. Quite possibly the worst movie ever made.  I think it's a great candidate for it  because it is generally so bad that it cannot be enjoyed. It is, it is  like sour milk. No matter which way you swirl it in your mouth it's just, it's just  awful.   Manos I think is a better candidate for the title than, say, Plan Nine From Outer Space which you can actually watch  and enjoy.  Manos is nearly unwatchable and I think the only,  the only decent excuse for watching it is either watching the episode of Mystery Science Theater or being Quentin Tarantino  and enjoying it for some reason.  He's clearly demented.    Manos is   The story about some   it doesn't make any sense.  There there's  a guy called the master who's played by this  menacing fellow here, who played a trucker kind of   who  owns a house and   a very strange satyr named  named  Torgo takes care of it for him. You can't really tell that Torgo's a satyr because you don't see his hooves so he just looks like a guy with very large knees and walks funny.  Incidentally the guy who played Torgo killed himself a few months after the film was released.   Family members and friends believe it was unrelated but I'm not so sure.   A a  vacationing family runs across this house, basically  fall under this spell, this strange cult that owns the, I don't know. It doesn't make any sense, it's ridiculous,  it's hilarious and yet a little creepy at the same time.  Which of course is the intent seeing as it is a horror movie, yet  the creepiness just kind of adds to the badness of it somehow and  it it  overall it's a  very unlikable {sigh} movie. Although the lore about it is   is fantastic.  If you just go online and read about this movie it's it's  quite interesting and hilarious how it came to be.   And  that's really the only good thing about it is the sort of cult following that is has, the movie itself is just awful. And it's even more unbearable to watch this uncut version. You know, watching Mystery Science Theater is bad enough.   This version's even worse, it's just this long sequences of nothing and  I don't know what they were thinking when they made this.  It was made by a fertilizer salesman so take that for what it's worth.  Manos: The Hands of Fate.	6.403
Hello. Today I'm reviewing the movie  Badder Santa   starring Billy Bob Thornton and Bernie Mac.   Essentially this is the unrated version of the theatrical release Bad Santa.    To me, this is a must see every holiday since it came out. It is an absolutely hilarious movie. Definitely the funniest thing I've ever seen  Billy Bob Thornton in. Now it caters to people with crude and rude humor and that's me.  Love this movie. I mean, it it's  just  so obnoxious, so over the top, so rude.  Essentially, Billy Bob Thornton  is a crook I mean is just a a  horrible contribution to society and he ends up being Santa Claus and watching him interact with these kids and  one kid in particular. I mean it's just over the top funny. Like I said, a must see every Christmas for me now.   Billy Bob Thornton at his definite funniest.  On this one, there are like I said this one is  the unrated edition.  So this has more footage than you see in the theaters if you went to see this one.  Lots of deleted and alternate scenes  all told over seven minutes of never before seen footage.  Behind the scenes outtakes and gag reels.  Gag reels and outtakes are probably  some of my my  favorite bonus features on any DVD. I love to laugh, so even with the most serious movie when they add outtakes I I  tend to crack up.  So this one's actually in widescreen format even though it doesn't really say it  but it is widescreen format and for me  this one's going to pull five out of five stars just for, I mean, butt gusting laughter. So five out of five for me. Thanks.	5.745
Hi today I'm reviewing  the DVD movie Rush Hour Three.  This movie like the previous two Rush Hour movies stars Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker.  This one actually takes place in Paris.  They're after a Chinese mastermind, there's  lots of action  in this movie  I did not find this Rush Hour Three  to be as funny as the other two Rush Hour movies. I really think they should've stopped at the first one because  in my opinion they kind of got progressively worse  after the first one.   If you are just   diehard fan of the Rush Hour series and just wanna see what happens next  then that's probably the only person that I would recommend  this DVD to.    Otherwise I just really wouldn't waste your time, it just did not measure up to the first two movies at all   especially the first one.  So   probably and unless  you're a really big fan then don't waste your time on Rush Hour Three.	6.403
Hi I'm here reviewing Aliens versus Predator: Requiem. This is the sequel to Alien Versus Predator which came out two years ago.   This movie, it was,  I, it was a pretty good horror movie.   There were a lot of frightening parts.  I know but this whole alien versus predator thing is just way too commercialized.   I felt like it's not doing justice to the original Alien, the original Predator movies.   In this movie,  a predator lands on earth to kill the aliens that escape from the ship at the end of the last movie.  And   couple of new things in this movie, there's a pred-alien combination predator alien that's kind of a,  cheesy and expected   you know, next step for this franchise.   And some of you were just kind of cheesy.  I don't like the whole Alien versus Predator franchise.  But it was you know, an entertaining horror movie if you're just looking to have a good time.  Not really looking for you know,  very well done movie.  I guess this movie will do. I'm personally gonna give it a two out of five.  I don't think it ever deserves more than that.   So yeah, thank you.	4.435
Hi, I'm Chris, and this is a review of the DVD for the movie The Bourne Supremacy, starring Matt Damon.  This is the second in the Bourne series of movies.  It is the followup to The Bourne Identity, and this movie picks up pretty much  where the other one left off.  After a while Jason Bourne has been living sort of off the grid and under the radar with his girlfriend. And he is finally  tracked down by the shadowy association  that has been looking looking  for him for a long time and  despite Jason Bourne's vow that he just wishes to be left alone   he has to come out of hiding because they are after him. And he picks up with his  superbly trained skills,  martial arts ability, weapons ability, and as you can see in this scene  driving ability.  The car chases in the Bourne series  first The Bourne Identity and  also this movie, The Bourne Supremacy,  really  take the cake and that shines through on this DVD.  The movie is action packed, it's non-stop from beginning to end. And it follows  Jason Bourne's quest to sort of retrace his past.  The  amnesia that he suffered from in the first movie  he begins to get flashbacks in bits and pieces in this one and he tries to   follow up on some of the things that he does remember, and that's, that's  a thread that weaves through the whole plot of this DVD. And there are a lot of  special features on this as well.  There's  some of the fight  training sequences. Shows Matt Damon going through  some of the moves with a fight trainer for the movie. That's pretty interesting. And they also show you how they have  a new vehicle that they use to film the  car chase sequences to make them seem more realistic, and I gotta tell you the car chase sequences are some of the best I've seen.  Probably right up there with the ones from the movie Bullitt. It's just  fantastic car chase scenes both in the first movie and in this one. That alone is worth the price of the DVD is just watching the car chases.  And  there's also a couple other  special features on this.  Some explosion things, pyrotechnic things they show you. Things like that and some stuff about  on location. All in all it's definitely worth the price. I would highly recommend this DVD of The Bourne Supremacy. Thanks.	5.354
Hi Expotv, this is Melissa again and you can check out my profile and my other reviews at PM three two one. I am reviewing for you today Star Wars Episode Five: Empire Strikes back.  I'm going to read a little bit off the back cause I always get them confused.  It's a dark time for the rebellion. After a devastating attack on their ice base on the frozen, frozen  planet of Hoth the rebels are scattered by imperial pursuit. Luke Skywalker seeks out the mysterious jedi master Yoda in the swamps of Dagobah while, while  Han Solo and Princess Leia outrun the imperial fleet to the beautiful cloud city of Bespin. In an attempt to convert Luke to the dark side the evil Darth Vader lures young Skywalker into a trap. In the midst of a fierce lightstaber duel with the Sith Lord, Luke faces a terrible truth about the Skywalker legacy.   This is just another fabulous movie. It's a great time to sit down with the family and just hang out, watch a movie, grab some popcorn, some goodies.   We watch these a lot. As I said I always get confused which one's which so I always have to read off the back of what's going on. We do have some special features. Commentary by George Lucas.   Irvin Kershner, Ben Burtt, Dennis Muren and Carrie Fisher.  You have the DVD-ROM weblink exclusive to Star Wars content and subtitles in English.   The nice thing is there's just so much action, there's such a great story line here. It's a classic. Star Wars is an absolute classic and if you haven't seen Star Wars I really don't know where you've been because everybody's seen it. So check it out and I hope you rewatch it if you haven't seen it in a while. Thanks.	5.066
Hi,   so Expo. Time to review a movie.    I really like Hilary Swank, I think she's a great actress and I think  she was fantastic in Boys Don't Cry. I didn't see the boxing movie cuz  I just heard that it was too grim. But   I thought she was tremendous in Boys Don't Cry, so I really wanted to see what she was up to. So I went to see P.S. I Love You.  Here's my little thingy.  Alright. Let me be frank.  She's just not sort of a romantic heroine in my mind.    It's  a sort of sickly sweet love story about a a  woman whose   husband dies and leaves her letters that  try to help her get back into life. And you know, it's a sweet idea and it was definitely worth seeing if you're looking for something  kind of  schmaltzy {laughter}  but  I'd recommend waiting for the DVD or   yeah. Definitely it's more of a renter. And she just doesn't have the   sort of,  romantic heroine  look.  I found her kind of  harsh and  it just didn't capitalize on her strengths. So not a highly recommended movie, probably like a two star movie. {laughter}  Definitely  you know if you got nothing better to do it's fine but not a fantastic movie.  Okay,  that's my opinion on it.	5.745
What's up Expo TV this is Thomas I'm reviewing the  movie of Four Brothers.  Starring  Mark Wahlberg,  Tyrese Gibson, Andre three thousand and Garrent Hedlund.  It's a very great movie it's  basically about   four orphans who gets adopted and they're all grown up.  And   They're, their   legal guardian mom  gets killed so they all come back.  And seek revenge on these people so   I honestly love this movie,  it's a full screen.  It's definitely rated R, a lot of killing  but it's an awesome movie.  I give it a five out of five stars.  So I definitely recommend you go into the store  and buying it. I don't recommend you renting it, you need to buy it because this is an awesome movie.  It's just full of action, comedy and just thrill. I love it.  I give it a five out of five star plays.	4.69
What's up Expo? Baby Mazor here. I am reviewing the movie   Enough starring  Jennifer Lopez, a very, very, very beautiful girl, Jennifer Lopez. But, yes   this is a very good movie. I mean I'm going to probably, I mean it's probably, kind of, just about girl, power, will. I don't know but   I'm going to give it five out of five stars. It's a really good movie. It's about  Jennifer Lopez falling in love with a guy who turns out to be not the guy she thought he was, but   a lot of stuff goes on in this.   There's a lot of fighting and  people die but, yeah.  I'm going to have to give it   like I said, five out of five stars because Jennifer Lopez is a main actor. She's an awesome actor and an awesome singer so pick up a CD or two. But    yeah, I'd recommend buying this, not even renting it just buying it because you're guaranteed to like it. So  Enough, Jennifer Lopez pick it up today.	2.16
Hi expo, this is my review of the movie Aladdin. This is a Disney movie, it's rated G. It's about   an hour and a half long.  This is a,  it's a pretty, it's a pretty  good movie, we like it a lot. My kids enjoy it.  It's one of the older Disney movies, I remember seeing it in theaters. It's the story about  Aladdin who's sort of a   a poor, kind of homeless kid and he's out  trying to  make a good life for himself. He falls in love with a princess, and the princess is being required to marry by her father who's the sultan and also by law, and so it's her quest to find a prince, but she must marry a prince. And of course Aladdin tries to  pretend to be a prince but everything sort of goes wrong and he  in the meantime finds a genie  and the genie is voiced by Robin Williams, and this is probably one of my favorite by  Robin Williams   as the genie. And the genie sort of helps him,  you know,  find a relationship and true love with the princess Jasmine.  There's a lot of fabulous music in this movie.  The kids love all the songs, and still sing them, and  we really enjoyed this movie. It's a great one to have in our collection.	4.243
Hi my name is Anesh and today I'm reviewing the movie Aliens versus Predators requiem which is currently running in theaters nationwide.   Now this movie is a sequel of the earlier movie and  sorry to say but it's not as good in fact it's terrible and  I rate this movie two on five to start with.   The movie is the same you know there's this war between the predators and aliens there's only one predator   left on earth and you know he contacts the base station and then  ask for backup  there lots of  you know, action sequences.   But none as good as the one that would and you know, in the earlier movie. This one is you know disappointing the scenes repeat again and again.   The same kind of action and you you  would not expect them to come up with something new something different that would actually gather the attention of the audience make it more interesting but  nothing that you can see in this movie.   Really disappointing,  two on five again and  you know if you're really big  fan of sci-fi these kind of movies  go to theaters otherwise you know just wait and maybe watch it on DVD later on.   Totally not recommended at all.  Alien versus Predators Requiem.	4.69
Hi expo. So I think I finally hit the wall, movie wise.  I   you know, I was thinking  "okay, Diane Keaton,   Queen Latifah, Katie Holmes, how bad can it be?" You know?  Diane Keaton's awesome, and Queen Latifah is totally cool, and Katie Holmes she's cute. Okay, here are the good things I can say about this movie.   They all had really good hair  and  it was nice to see Katie Holmes with a man her own age {laugh}. I wish I could take credit for that comment but  somebody else said it.  So anyway  I'm talking about Mad Money.  Really  not a great movie. In fact  I think it speaks to the moral bankruptcy of our culture {laugh} and my own bad taste that I would go to this movie. So   I can't begin to tell you how bad I think this movie is, and I'm really sorry because it actually could have been kind of good. So  I'll give it one star for , actually half a star for their hair,  everybody had good hair, and   half a star for  Katie Holmes' dancing.  But that's about it. So, yeah,  I don't recommend it.	4.509
Hi. Today I'd like review Bee Movie,  which is an animated movie currently in theaters.  This is   written by Jerry Seinfeld and it stars  Jerry Seinfeld and  Rene Zellweger, or the voices of them cause it's computer animated.   But this is an okay movie but overall I just found it to be  not very interesting, like I didn't see the point. It wasn't  any different than all those other animated movies  about bugs or toys or  stuff like that.   I love, you know, Toy Story and Ratatouille and most of the Pixar movies   but this was just really generic and maybe it had a few funny one liners and  Seinfeld was his normal self, but  overall I just didn't see the point. I mean besides the good animation    I really can't recommend it unless you have little kids cause they'd probably enjoy it, but  other than that not a great movie. So I give Bee Movie a  four out of ten. Thanks.	3.742
Hi. I am here to review the movie Platinum Blonde.   This is a movie directed by Frank Capra   starring Jean Harlow.   This is a movie about a   newspaper reporter, hard working, lower class, honest to the fault, newspaper reporter investigating   something that happen in a rich family  who with their  daughter Jean Harlow.    The Jean Harlow character    seduces   the young innocent   crusading  newspaper reporter and   also in this movie we have the young Loretta Young  who is incredibly beautiful and our intrepid reporter  for whatever reason ignores her.   The problem I have with this movie is,  despite how old I look,  Jean Harlow is before my time  and  I don't  sense the appeal of the Jean Harlow.   big west was before my time and I can see her appeal and what she meant to  the audience and why men were intrigued by her   and  as far as Frank Frank  Capra goes,  he has made much  better movies after Platinum Blonde.   Disappointing in my book.	5.099
Hi, I'm here to review In the Name of the King.  It's a film currently in theaters.  It's based on the xxx series of video games.  This one was horrible. I'm giving it a one out of five.  It takes place in medieval times and it's about an ongoing war  between   I don't even know. {laughter} This movie had horrible plot, horrible acting, horrible dialogue, horrible special effects, horrible action.  There was no saving grace for this film.  It starred Jason Statham so I thought it would be  good cause he tends to be in pretty good movies but no, this was a let down.   It's directed by Uwe Boll who is known for making pretty bad movies  however  this film  see  most of his films are bad enough that they're funny, you can laugh at them. This one doesn't even offer that it's just boring more than anything.   It tries to be Lord of the Rings.  It has a many of orge like creatures, a wizard, a medieval time setting. Basically stole everything out of Lord of the Rings but made a million times worse.   It's just everyone stay away from this film. It was a horrible movie.  So yea that's In the Name of the King in a nutshell. Thank you.	4.435
Hi, I'm Chris, and this is a review of the DVD of the movie Constantine  starring Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weiss.   In this movie Keanu Reeves plays a sort of    exorcist kind of a character where he performs exorcisms and he is  in touch with the demon world.  His character is John Constantine, hence the title, and this is based on a series of  graphic novels  and he he  can see demons and he can see  otherworld spirits and he basically fights them. He has   some fairly strange weapons that he uses this, that he uses to do this.   Holy water and a shotgun made out of a crucifix. It's a fairly strange movie.  I know it's based on a graphic novel and those movies can tend to  run on the strange side.  This movie's a little stranger than most,  it really was very odd.   If you're into this kind of stuff I guess it was okay. There's a big sort of  conspiracy to unleash a bunch of demons from hell and  Keanu Reeves is trying to stop this and   Rachel Weiss plays a cop who sort of reluctantly agrees to help him, basically reluctantly because she doesn't really believe him and he has an assistant who  the assistant has some pretty funny parts. He's not bad but ,  I don't know. This movie just didn't do it for me.   I really didn't enjoy it. I I  slogged my way through it but it it  really wasn't that interesting.   I really wouldn't recommend this, I've seen this sort of  theme done better.   As far as the DVD goes there are eighteen minutes of additional footage which usually  these scenes are cut out of the movie for a pretty good reason. They really don't add anything to the movie. There's an alternate ending which isn't any better or any worse than the original ending, then there's you know theatrical content,  theatrical trailer and different languages and stuff like that.   Maybe rent this but I definitely wouldn't buy it.  So that's the DVD of the movie Constantine starring Keanu Reeves. Thanks.	5.354
Hi, I'm here to review the movie Donnie Darko, starring Jake Gyllenhaal,  his sister Maggie Gyllenhaal  Drew Barrymore  Catherine Ross.   This is a movie about a very disturbed  teenage boy.  He's seeing a psychiatrist and   he may or may not be seeing a     six foot tall rabbit called Frank, who   tells him he's a time traveler.   So we have  it's kind of  two ways that you're looking at this movie. This is strictly a movie about a disturbed young man, or it is a movie about a man who, a young man who is so incredibly intelligent that he has been able to make contact with  a time traveler.   This movie explores  the teenage social structure in high schools.    Adults who are not what they appear to be.  This is a really good movie. It's really thought provoking.  It's a excellent job by Jake Gyllenhaal as Donnie Darko. I high highly  recommend it.	5.354
Hi expo. This is my review on the movie  The Ladykillers.   I'm a big Tom Hanks fan but I really wasn't all that impressed with this movie. It seemed like there was a lot of drag time in this movie.  Yeah there were  some funny scenes but  very few. And   for a Tom Hanks movie I was really let down.   However that is my opinion and  it's rated R for language, crude scenes,  some violence and   it's a hundred and four minutes long. There's several different actors in this movie.  And however,  you know,  it's just not as great as I expected it to be. And again I think this is another movie where my expectations were a lot higher than they should have been. So  I'd probably give this one a two and  if you wanna check it out   you might like it better than I did. That's The Ladykillers. Thanks.	4.69
Hi expo. {clears throat} This is Nikki. This is my review on My Date with Drew.   Don't waste your time. This is a terrible movie.  A guy   who's had this lifelong  crush on Drew Barrymore   decides twenty years later that he's going to make his dream come true and go on a date. Okay, that's all I'll say,  but that's all that matters.  It's terrible. It's actually terrible. It's not funny, it's not interesting.    I'm actually kind of sad I own this movie but  anyway  it's  ninety minutes long, it's rated PG.   Who knows? Somebody might like it.   I wouldn't recommend it. I'd probably give this one a one, if that. So   if you're wanting to see a terrible movie just to see how bad movies can get,  this would be the one to check out.  My Date with Drew. Thanks.	7.0
Hi Expo, this is Nikki.  This is my review on the movie National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation Two.   definitely not as good as the first.   I think they were reaching for this one. , I think since they had  such a good one the first time. , I think they thought that they could probably put another one together and   my personal opinion, I think they failed miserably, but, you know, again,that's my opinion.  I wouldn't recommend this to anybody, really.    I was just greatly disappointed.  Randy Quaid xxx yeah, {laugh} there's some funny things that he does,  but he did those things in the first one.   it's   not rated.  Eighty-three minutes long. , it should be rated junk. , so if   you really want to   yeah, don't don't  waste your time, it's it's  really terrible.  So, thanks.	6.403
Alright Expo TV, this is my video review of the movie Sweeney Todd.   This movie, when I saw it, this movie looked sweet. I mean it had everything, it looked I mean it was about this serial killer like barber guy and it had Johnny Depp and he was dressed up looking all sweet and so I was like yes I'm gonna go see this movie.  I obviously did not do enough research  before I saw the movie, which  you are a good person if you're watching this video because you're trying to do some research before you go out there and spend the   looks like six fifty on the movie.   This movie is a musical. So, if you don't like musicals, don't go see this movie. As soon as they started singing, I was just like, what did I get myself into, you know? I mean, I couldn't, I could not  get past that.  So, if you can get past the fact that there's Johnny Depp singing in this movie,   more power to you I guess. You're gonna enjoy this one. I did not. It has the same director as the guy from Nightmare Before Christmas. Figured this was gonna sweet movie, I didn't think he'd, well I mean I really wasn't probably thinking at all, because if you think about it, The Nightmare Before Christmas is sort of like a musical.  So,  I don't know, I made a bad choice with this movie. I don't think it's fair of me to give it a one out of five, but that's what I'm gonna give it. So, you're gonna have to see this one by yourself, probably.	6.403
Hello I'd like to tell you about a movie that I recently saw. This is  a Bee Movie starring Jerry Seinfeld.   This has a list of characters in here, there's Kathy Bates, Oprah Winfrey, Michael Richards,  Chris Rock, Ray Liotta, the list goes on and on and on. There are so many cameos of voices that you cannot keep up with them.   Actually I wrote them down because there's so many, Rip Torn, Larry Miller,   Patrick Warburton, Larry King who often plays cameos.  This bee  is called Barry bee. He  is the voice of,   is Jerry Seinfeld. He breaks rule number one, he talks to people. And so he actually talks to a florist, she saves his life and therefore she helps him find a lawyer who  basically he's going to sue humans for stealing his bee honey and from then on people are worried, the bees are worried that he's going to with people and his mother at at least  talking to the woman, that he's talking to his bee life or bee-ish. I thought that was kind of cute.  There are so many actors and actresses in this it could have been so good, it could have been like Ratatouille but it wasn't. So that's all I have to say for it there's a lot of one liners and they absolutely hit flat bottom they're not funny. So this is not a kid's movie, it's an adults movie, it's a Jerry Seinfeld movie Jerry could do better. Next time maybe, maybe  he will Jerry  next time do better.	6.683
Hello, I'd like to tell you about Untraceable. It's a movie I've seen recently starring Diane Lane, Billy Burke, and  Colin Hanks. Colin Hanks is   the son of Tom Hanks, and he's been in quite a few movies but until recently he has  had very small roles.   He is a very good actor and I was glad to see him in this movie. As far as the movie, it's about  the FBI, the the  special unit that investigates murder plots or any types of crime on the internet.  Welcome to the agents of cyberspace, where  Diane Lane who is a special investigator for the FBI.   Actually,   she plays as Jennifer Marsh and her coworker is Colin Hanks. They come across a very   terrible website where a predator actually kills his victims and it's up to the   audience, or the people that work with him on the internet because the more hits he gets   by people watching the crimes, the faster the people die. It's a very gory plot, he shows   some terrible scenes, some graphic, terrible, awful scenes. They're not entertaining, they're gross, they're not really meant to be seen.  It's sickening, it's a sicko movie. It's, there's nothing about it that's good.   It's, the movie, first of all the plot is not plausible. Second of all    Jennifer Marsh, or Diane Lane, comes across a website of I believe it was called  kill with me dot com and it actually shows a starving cat. The cat has actually been starved to death. It shows another scene where a person is bound and it has the the  person's name branded on the person's chest, and it just gets worse and worse and worse. This movie actually is pitiful.   It's not scary, it's sick, and you're going to have nightmares if you watch it. Some people gave it a two, a few people were generous with a one,  some people even  dared put down one and a half, I'm not even gonna give it a twinkle. This movie should be in a black hole, that's it.	5.0
Hello. I like to tell you about a movie I saw recently. It's Beowulf starring Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich.  This movie could have been really great if they had taken into the direction of three-hundred or possibly Lord of the Rings, they didn't do that.   The premise of the story  first of all this is a poem or a story written by an unknown character as it's the first ever written that we have found  besides Homers.   It's  a great story really about a lifestyle of people.   Beowulf is a good guy. Grendel is a really bad guy, he's a monster. Beowulf and the community around him have to protect themselves from Grendel.   Actually I this in college a very long time, for so long that you began to hate it but, then I look back and I kind of understand why it was important to learn about it. Actually I think Grendel was basically another group of people that were trying to take over another society. The monster possibly were wearing these huge face masks so this movie didn't portray it like that. They actually had Grendel as some really ugly monster and Angelina Jolie as a gorgeous mother who would make Grendel look like a sweet heart because she was so evil. So of her good looks because they didn't try to, you know, make her look evil, they just had her made her look like  Angelina Jolie with extra gloss. I mean, we don't need that, she has lips we know we see them she doesn't need that. So   I am disappointed in the way it was presented. It is an epic tale, it's a good story, it's a great history about people,   animation of the the  new age   type deal was terrible, and like I said she didn't fit the character. John Malkovich was okay he didn't help though. So  this one  two and a half.	6.403
Name is Mike and this is my ExpoTV review of the film Meet the Spartans, which is basically a spoof, primarily of the  the movie three hundred.   The film doesn't have a lot of what you'd call really big stars.   I think the closest  big star that they have in there is Carmen Electra and only a couple parts of her are big.  The, this movie is pretty much a waste of time. It's a spoof movie sort of like a Scary Movie  and  the Airplane movies, where just it's a lot of  fast paced quick one liners and things along that nature.  Overall, I can't give it a good recommendation.  Most of the jokes were pretty predictable.  There was an unfortunate situation where that Chris Crocker guy who says "leave Britney alone" is in the movie with a clip and then that pretty much sort of sold me on  the fact that this was pretty much a bad movie. So  they  they probably maybe will do a sequel to this. Hopefully they won't. But if you're  looking for a good movie to see this weekend or next weekend  this is one to definitely avoid. I'm Mike with ExpoTV and that's my Meet the Spartans review.	5.686
Hi, Expo. This is Melissa. You can check out my profile and my reviews at PM three two one to see what I have been talking about lately. {Cough} Excuse me.  We are talking about today Naked Gun thirty three and a half: The Final Insult. And I agree, this is horrible. It is a final insult.  The first two movies, I hated. This one, I hated even worse. So my husband and I were just joking around that if there was an option on Expo, I would click a zero out of five. But there's not, so I had to go with one out of five. It's that bad.  Created by the Zucker brothers, we have the whole gang back again, Leslie Nielsen, Priscilla, Priscilla  Presley, O.J. Simpson. This time, you have Anna Nichole Smith, which they  in the previews, say her name over and over and over again. They must be so excited that she's given them her presence. But she doesn't do the best job acting in this at all.   Basically, you have Lt. Frank Drevin, who is stopping a terrorist plot that could mean curtains for him, or will a simple simple  window shade be enough?   Basically, we have a state of the art advance and sequel numbering are the filmmakers you love, the returning stars you adore, plus others.  We have Fred Ward, Anna Nichole Smith, as I said,  O.J. Simpson, just everybody from the Police Squad Files.  It's just not a movie I would  spend my five dollars on, basically. But my husband did because he gives it a five out of five. I give it a zero out of five. And, hey, if you like it, check it out.	5.033
Hi guys.   my name is xxx and today I'll be talking about the movie  Hitman.  this movie was released last year and it's about an agent who   in the, in this  film  the name of the agent if forty-seven.  whose role is being played by Timothy Ol Olyphant  and he he's  basically  kind of an agent who works on the other  so  and he he  like he is in a xxx of control and russian   kind, russian agents because   he was like  he was about to kill  president and what   he was being seen by one of the witness. So he chased him and  so this movie was quite  full of techno stuff and was kind of a blue movie where like things moved sometimes fast and sometimes slow but I would just say this movie was just an average movie and  I'm going to give this movie like  maybe two out five. Again my name is xxx and I have given my review on the movie Hitman.	2.38
Today I'm going to review One Missed Call, and this is a new horror kind of movie that I guess is most similar to similar to  horror movies like The Ring The Ring , which was centered around a video tape. This one's obviously centered around a cell phone and one missed call. Now these movies, they seem to,  like they're not really gonna stand the test of time. Like you know thirty years from now most people aren't going to really remember this movie. And  yeah, no one's really going to think it's is the best movie of all time.  And  unfortunately you know that's the case.  Some people might wanna check it out for like  a popcorn kind of flick. Just see it once in theaters, or maybe rent it  you know, for a night time viewing and  see if you can get scared essentially.  Is it an entertaining movie? That depends on what you  what your tastes are essentially. If you found movies like a Jeepers Creepers or   Final Destination to be entertaining, you might find One Missed Call to be entertaining as well. If you're looking for a well done kind of horror movie  you know, with goo  with high production values and stuff like that   you know, I would recommend something like The Shining or even The Ring more so than this. So it really depends on your tastes and how much you're interested in the horror kind of  thriller suspense genre.   So yeah I personally didn't like it all that much, but I guess it all depends on your taste.	3.559
What's up ExpoTV, I'm watching right now the Bourne Supremacy. It's the  second movie of the three Bourne films, and it's starring Matt Damon as Jason Bourne. This is the widescreen version.  It's rated PG-thirteen for violence, intense action and brief language, and  it's an hour and forty-nine minutes long.  In this movie, Matt Damon's character Jason Bourne  it it  starts off  after the first one and  what happens is, he's just hanging out, trying to hide out from  the people who came after him in the first one. And they actually find him and his girlfriend. And these people kill his girlfriend, so the rest of the movie is pretty much about him coming back, and like   like chasing after these guys and trying to assassinate them. But  it's a really awesome movie, Matt Damon's  like an awesome actor and all the action is really crazy and it's really fast-paced, so if you're into good action movies this is the one to get. The Bourne Supremacy. I give it a five out of five.	3.742
This is my review of Walt Disney's Beauty and the Beast.  This is the special edition two disc platinum edition.  This is probably my all time favorite Disney princess movie.  I watch this with my daughters.  They all love it, even my seven year old still really liked it. She can still watch it over and over again.  And looking forward to watching it with my two year old as well.  A lot of the neat features on the two disc  version are   there's a Celine Dion and xxx music video. There's never before released behind the scenes footage.  There's some games and  there are three different versions of the film.  You do get a lot of extra stuff by buying the platinum edition. And  But really the best part is the classic Beauty and the Beast movie.  Definitely can't go wrong with this one. It's wonderful animation and the cutest characters and  really really good music.  My favorite songs are in this movie from  out of all the Disney princess movies. So  definitely one of our favorites in our Disney library and I highly recommend it. It's Disney's Beauty and the Beast special edition.	3.162
Hello, my name is Sarah and I will be doing my video opinion of the Walt Disney movie Underdog.  This was absolutely my favorite movie  of, of  the year  I really enjoyed this movie.  Basically the title says underdog, the movie was about a canine who had an accident in a lab with  a doctor  a mad scientist, and end up getting the ability to talk and have the ability to have all these great superpowers.  He can run really fast, and he do these really cool flips,   you know it was just a lot of different things that you know, a basic superhero might have you know, strength, speed. Basically the dog had it.  He end up coming across a  family who took him in. And   you know, basically he was just going around town and and  saving people and and  you know, trying to  understand what he was going through and the abilities that he had. Trying to figure out how they worked and what to do with them.   This movie was just unbelievable  it was hilarious, it was family, it was friend, you know you can watch it with friends, family,  all ages.  It made you laugh so I really enjoyed this movie. I know you will too, I recommend the movie Underdog.	6.055
This is What Women Want, with Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt.  This is supposed to be a very romantic comedy, but I find it to be ridiculous and stupid.   Don't rent this or buy it or ever watch it, ever, ever, ever, because it's dumb. And if you are dumb then you can watch it and you can be like, oh I like this movie. But if you're not dumb, you'll stay away from it because it's stupid.  It's PG-thirteen. It's a hundrend-and-twenty-six minutes long.   Mel Gibson  is trying to , he's in advertising and he's trying to  think like a woman and he  so he's dresses like a woman and whatnot, and he ends up getting like electrocuted or something, and  he can hear what women think, and    so he uses that to be able to   woo Helen Hunt's character.  And then he finds that he really does love her.    It's ridiculous and so I would not recommend What Women Want.	6.055
Hi guys,  my name is Sumit and today I'll be talking about the latest released movie, One Missed Call.  This movie was released few weeks back and   it was not not    good movie. It was supposed to be horror, but it's not that good a horror movie.   This is origin   basically  movie release in Japan  in two-thousand-three and this is a remake . It's an English version of that movie.  This movie starts with a story that a few people get a call or get a voicemail that how they died.  Like what time, what date, what place  in their previous life and they got horrified and then some sudden deaths happen and they're all like surprised and too scared to tell everyone, And then they   there was a spirit,  some sort of, in this movie, so.  I didn't like this movie much, so I'm going to give this movie like two out of five. Again, my name is Sumit and I've given my view on the movie One Missed Call.	3.317
Hi, I'm Valerie and today I'm going to be reviewing the film Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  This is the Bueller Bueller edition so you get  some special features like   they have the cast of Ferris Bueller's Day Off  they have the making of it  and they also have the cast album. So, it's a fun features and if you haven't seen this movie before, it's about this character Ferris Bueller, played by Matthew Broderick, and he   he  pretends that he is sick for the day so he doesn't have to go to school and soon his day off  he does all these things and has all these adventures and   so he's he's  this really talented kid who's really good at making people believe that you know, that he's really sick. He has the whole school talking about it and he just you know. Somehow the whole school knows and his sister, she's older, she knows he's playing and that he's not really sick and so she gets kind of angry at this and she's trying to expose him. So it's a really fun story and  just to see all the things that they do and just as the story develops, it's really funny. So if you haven't seen this movie, I definitely recommend going to see it and I give it a five out of five.	2.0
Hello and welcome to my review of the movie Twenty-Seven Dresses.  This movie  starring Katherine Heigl  most of you probably know her from  either Grey's Anatomy  the ABC tv show. Or    you may also know her from the movie Knocked Up. Knocked Up was a hilarious movie that I really enjoyed and  was expecting something along that lines for this movie.  It's about  a girl who's kind of proverbially always a bridesmaid never the bride,  hence the name of the movie Twenty-Seven Dresses.  She's been in twenty-seven different weddings and has twenty-seven hideous bridesmaid dresses to prove it.   It's just kind of one of those predictable movies that  I don't think I would recommend going to see.  I I  was pretty disappointed with with  it overall.   It's just you know, I had a few laughs and that sort of thing but nothing you know just,  compared to Knocked Up which was just absolutely fall on the floor laughs I didn't think it was nearly as good.  You know Katherine Heigl does  a a  good job and she is kind of settling into a comedic role,  so she does a good job acting it's no, not  a problem with the acting it's more a problem with the story. So overall I would not recommend seeing this movie I would give it two out of five stars.   Maybe if you know you  it, you might get it on dvd  but   rent rent  it I certainly wouldn't purchase it but I wouldn't waste my money at the theater.	5.066
Expo  I'm gonna talk about the movie Fred Claus.  It's still in theaters, I don't know if it is or not and  it stars Vince Vaughn and Paul Giamatti.  Vince Vaughn you really disappointed me with this one. He usually, Vince Vaughn's a hilarious guy. In Fact, that's why I went to see the movie, cause Vince Vaughn's in it. And that's why I guarantee a lot of people went to see the movie cause they thought Vince Vaughn was in it, it's probably funny. It's probably a hilarious movie. But it's really not that funny. It's really kind of a stupid movie. I mean, it's not the worst movie I've ever seen but it is it is  not that great of a movie at all.  I wouldn't recommend seeing it   in theaters. I wouldn't recommend paying full price. If you wanted to wait until it came out on DVD I I  would I suggest doing that. But if you didn't see it at all in general,  no, no  harm no foul. I mean seriously, it's not that great of a movie. So basic plot,  Vince Vaughn is, his name's Fred, and he is the older brother of Santa Claus and they have the whole family thing you know cause he's brothers and they got parents and then this whole  dramatic structure of how their in a relationship with family and how Fred's supposed to be more like  Santa Claus, which is his brother. But his his name's Nick, obviously you know Saint Nicholas, his name's Nick. So  It's this whole family kind of comedy thing about how they how they don't get along and then  the main plots really about how  you know Fred  he should be more like his brother and how but Fred kinda keeps messing up with his brother and like he marks everybody on the on the , he believes everybody shouldn't get a president present  on Christmas and  I mean, it's just it's just crazy stupid. It's just stupid, okay. It's really not that funny. I don't even know what I was saying when it was a decent movie. It's really stupid. In fact just thinking about it just makes me mad because I went to go see it and Vince Vaughn really disappointed me and I hope his next movie's not like that cause if his next movie's like that, I'm gonna be disappointed and his Wild Wild West show just came out recently and I'm not gonna go see it because of that. You disappointed me and I don't know, you know. So, I don't know, Vince Vaughn you disappointed me. But the movie's not that great, okay. It's terrible. It's terrible, that's it, it's terrible.	5.354
Expo,   I'm gonna get really insane about this one.  I'm gonna do a review here on Meet the Spartans. Somebody kill me now, who keeps making these movies? Seriously. Who keeps making these movies. They're terrible. Don't go see it. If somebody comes up to you and is like, hey, you wanna go see the movie for free? I'll pay you to go see the movie. Don't go see it, it's not worth it. It's not worth it, you'll question life. You'll seriously question living. Seriously it's terrible, it is terrible. Okay it's another one of these movies that parodies movies and it's just stupid. You think they would have learned this after all the scary movies, what they made like four already? They made four Scary Movies and made this epic, epic  movie, they made this date movie. And this is supposedly one of the sequels to like epic movie I think. But they had to be, call it, they had to call it Meet the Spartans because every movie did so bad. Just, just stop making the movies. Just stop making them. Okay come up with something more original than copying other people or trying to make fun of them. It's just stupid. So, it just made me so mad just even talking about this. Giving this review just makes me so mad about this movie, so.  I mean here is some movies they did: Three Hundred, Chainsaw Massacre, Spider-Man Three, they parodied Britney Spears. You know, they just did all this stupid stuff. What can I say I mean that's really about it. I mean seriously just drop these parodying of movies, just a whole bunch of recent movies they parodied and  you know, who was in it.  It wasn't Pamela Anderson it was, I don't know what her name even was.  Carmen Elektra,  that's who's in it. Just made me so mad, seriously, just stop making these movies, that's all I gotta just to say. I give it like, zero out of five if I could. Like I give it negative. Okay, I give it negative it's terrible, it's all I gotta say. Don't waste your life. Don't see it on DVD when it comes out. Don't, if your kids like, if if  you're a parent and your kid's like hey, oh well I'm gonna go out with  my friends we're about to go see  they're like ten years old it doesn't even matter, but like I'm about to go see it just be like no, you're grounded. Like you are grounded, you go to your room for the rest of the night. Just because they were even thinking about going to see it. Just be like, go to your room, seriously.  That's all I gotta say.	5.745
Hi. Today I wanted to do a review on the movie, The Heartbreak Kid.  Yeah. Let me just show you a little clip first.  {movie_16.295_26.894}  Alright. That clip right there was  {cough}  this guy you know he's  had some girlfriends but he's kind of afraid of commitment and   he, for some reason, he is kinda good friends with some of his previous and he was at a wedding of one of his girlfriend's, previous girlfriend's, wedding.  There's the movie as you can see.  Case.  But,   what I wanted to say about this movie is that I am going to give it a one out of five stars just because  if you have any morals what so ever, you won't watch this movie just because  one, it's very crude  so much unnecessary stuff goes on,  seems like there's always sexting or something inappropriate so I don't recommend it for kids and two, it promotes like saying like it's okay to  divorce and just you know garbage like that  which you know there's so much divorce already and in, you know, United States, why do we need a movie saying it's okay so basically what happens he meets this girl and they get married and they go on their honey moon and then he starts hanging out with another girl but I'm not going to ruin it but, yeah. Like, like  I am saying, you know, I don't know. I just, I didn't  think the movie was that good and  without ruining anything just I mean, think about your morals {laughs} so that's my  opinion on this and what will he do you know Is he going to be a man What's he going to do But Alright this is The Heartbreak Kid. Thanks.	5.0
Hello everyone. Playing over my shoulder here, is this, it is Twenty-Eight Weeks Later. This is not to be confused with Twenty-Eight Days Later, this is the sequel to Twenty-Eight Days later, once again entitled Twenty-Eight Weeks Later.  It stars  Robert Carlyle here, who you may remember as Begbie from Trainspotting. He plays  the father of two kids and   his wife  is , him and his wife and a bunch of people are , are  barricaded inside of a house and they are trying to   survive a zombie infestation and  he makes a  critical decision in regards to the well-being of his wife. I won't say what happens to her, I do not wish to spoil the movie. And  yeah, this movie   it it  was really just okay. It started off really well   in terms of  what they did with his character, I wasn't expecting him to do what he did in the beginning of the movie.   But  yeah, it was it was   it was  just an okay movie, it wasn't as interesting the first movie, as certain sequals often are.  It just kind of  ran out of ideas about halfway through and just kind of  became, you know,  just a run of the mill action movie after that, a  run of the mill zombie infestation movie.  There are some really good visuals in it, there's a pretty decent cast they could have done  something a lot better than  what they did with it I thought.  But  yeah the first half of it is really good, so at least it's got that going for it.  There's a commentary track on the DVD  with the director if you're interested in listening to it. I I  was not, I have not listened to it.   And there's various other  making of accouterments, theatrical trailer,   you know, standard special edition DVD . There are are some good ideas in it, but all in all it was just kind a blah sequel.  So  yeah, if you really like zombie movies maybe give this one a once around, but I would not suggest buying it.	5.066
Hello, I'm going to do a movie review and it is about the previous number one movie Meet the Spartans. Well  there's one thing that you need to know about Meet the Spartans, it is like three hundred,  obviously as you should know.  It has a British guy from  Off Center and also in other  like movies.  He also  was in    NYPD Blue like blue city and such. And like   Well Meet the Spartans is a very cheap knock off. It wasn't that great, it was really bad.  It was spent a whole bunch of money on it, but it wasn't that great.  Some  like  people expected it to be great because of three hundred but it wasn't. Like it was pretty offensive. The things like like  the fight scene. Like when  xxx it was really offensive and it wasn't that funny  and like they were they  like pretty they go to the extreme all the time. Like, they also  explain the riff of the materials they use so it's like, what the heck?  I, the first twenty minutes when I watched it, it was kinda like three hundred, but a little bit different by adding comedy. It wasn't that great, it wasn't  good and it wasn't that funny. Like, sure it has cheap cheap jokes. But it wasn't that great. Like  seriously like      xxx   In the beginning they had like, there's a child like, as a seeing who which child can  get along and it was Shrek and you're like what the heck, that's pretty funny. Ha ha ha, but after awhile you're just like, oh okay. And  it's just like three hundred, but weirder and not, like they tried to be funny. You have to admit that. But it's not that great, so I highly do not recommend you to watch Meet The Spartans. Save your money and buy some watch another movie, like Rambo or something like that.	2.708
Hey guys, I'm going to be reviewing The Golden Compass today. I saw it in theaters a few weeks ago.  I read the book. I read it several times, it's one of my favorite books in the whole world and the movie is just terrible. It really doesn't do the book justice at all.  They changed things in the plot around. They added new things. They took away really important facts. They ended it  early. It was just not good. I mean, not even close to how good the book was.  It did have some things going for it I guess. The acting was pretty good. Nicole Kidman was a, she was a good Misses Colter. She was pretty much how I imagined her, except for the blond hair. Misses Colter was supposed to have black hair but that's okay.   The lead actress was okay I guess. She wasn't exactly how I had pictured Lyra as being but she was okay. She did a decent job. And they did pretty good special effects with the demons and things like that.  So, I guess it has those things going for it but, overall I was definitely not impressed  and I really wouldn't recommend it.  I'd just read the book instead. Seriously, the movie is  nothing compared to the book.	5.745
Hi. Today I'm reviewing a movie called Fourteen-oh-eight   and this movie's pretty sweet.   I can't go any farther without telling you it's a five out of five stars. It's really sweet.   It's a good movie, it's really weird and twisted but it's a great movie.  And you gotta watch the movie to see that cause a lot of it comes toward the end of the movie. But   yeah basically it's about this this  guy that he's really into like, you know, got the ghost sightings and stuff so he'll go, he'll stay places where they say they've seen them and just to check if anything's really going on, stuff like that. And he doesn't believe in em cause nothing ever happens to him. He writes books and stuff about it, he's a writer. But   yeah, basically  he hears about this place and he's kind of famous, not really famous, but so so.  People know who he is but his books are always in like bargain bins and stuff like that. But  yeah it's really good,  and   oh yeah. So he   hears about this  hotel in New York that like anyone that stays there, like they closed it down because people always die when they they're  in it even for like a few minutes, so  cause it just makes them insane and stuff like that. But    yeah it's a great movie. I don't want to give away too much but definitely check out Fourteen-oh-eight.  He ends up going and he stays  in it, but I'm not saying how long or any of that. Just gotta watch it, but it's  Fourteen-oh-eight and I'll show you the little clip. This is more at the beginning, and there's some language and haunting sights so not recommended for kids.  {movie}  And this is the,  he has kind of like a meet the author kind of thing going on,  and he's just showing up a little bit early, whatnot, getting the deal going.  {movie}  As you can tell not a whole lot of people know who he is right there.  {movie}   Okay, well,  yeah seriously you got to check this movie out, five out of five stars. Gonna show you the DVD just so you know that I have it.  Fourteen-oh-eight. Fourteen-oh-eight. Some big names in it as well.  But yeah.  Thank you.	5.598
Hi, today I am reviewing a  a movie called Snakes on a Plane.  That's right it's snakes and they're on a plane. How crazy is that? Seriously.  Crazy concept, actually it's kind of dumb.   But  yeah. And whenever you watch this you'll realize that the movie's kind of dumb.   I don't know, it was different so I was like sweet. It's gonna be rad. Yeah, it's not that good. Pretty cheesy.  Kind of dumb everything.  The acting's okay but the snakes are so ridiculously fake. Like I don't know I've seen other people say oh they're so real. I think they're so fake. Like you can even tell it's fake. But  basically I mean that's what the movie's about obviously. There's    passenger plane and  somehow snakes get loaded on and then they just go crazy. So yeah it's it's  pretty adventurous and   Yeah, so I don't know, It's a little different. I'm gonna give it two out of five. So here's a little scene.  {movie_88.064_91.504}  And this is at the beginning of the movie,  well towards the beginning. Right before they leave.  {movie_98.500_99.700}  There's a lot of language and stuff.  {movie_101.608_103.004}  That's one of the famous guys  that's on the plane.  {movie_108.22_108.977}  Yeah so  {movie_110.211_111.525}  But yeah that's a little clip of it  and    It's not, may give little kids nightmares so I don't really recommend it but. There's Snakes on a Plane.  So go check it out if you want something funny to laugh at. So two out of five. Thanks.	4.082
Hello and welcome to my review of  Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.   This is an unusual movie. Johnny Depp seems to like to do these weird characters and just weird movies.  He tends to play the roles well.  I will say that Johnny Depp again does a good job in this movie although I did not like this movie.  It it's  kind of an unusual movie in the fact that it's a musical. So first off  I'm not big into musicals myself, you may be, so you may like it a little better but   actually my parents love musicals and they hated this movie as well, is what they told me so . I don't know, I just  I didn't think the movie was, you know, it was well acted, Johnny Depp, you know, he just plays a good weird guy but other than that  the story,  you know, you may be familiar with the story. A guy, you know, tries to get revenge  and kills a lot of people  as a barber because he's got a mess of  a willing victim sitting there in his chair so . But it just, the movie didn't do it for me and  I certainly would not waste my money going to see it in the theater. I would only give it one out of five stars.	4.83
Hello expotv land. It's me, Danny Ericson, and I'm here to talk to you about the film currently in theaters The Golden Compass, with Nicole Kidman, Dakota Blue Richard, and Daniel Craig,  the list goes on. But I  think, well I haven't read the books, but the movie didn't, was really not that intriguing. It was, it was  kind of an intriguing  idea kind of thing.   The soul of a person connected to a animal but I feel like the movie did not pull anything off. It really wasn't its own  entity, so to speak. It didn't really,  it it  seemed to rely too much on the viewer's background knowledge of the book.  It really wasn't that engaging and it just kept going on and on. It was a long movie. It seemed like more than two hours and    probably it was  unknown to me it was only the first part of a series of movies so it didn't really have any resolution at all. The acting was actually pretty good. I thought Nicole Kidman did a great job but it really just wasn't an engaging movie and I'm a fan of fantasy movies but it just didn't really engage me in any way so I wouldn't  probably recommend this movie.	3.786
Hello everyone, this movie that's playing right here is this, this is the Criterion Collection edition of The Silence of the Lambs. This is a really good movie, it's one of my favorite movies. It was directed by  Jonathan Demme and  written by Ted Tally, adapted from the Thomas Harris novel of the same name.  It stars Jodie Foster as a   FBI  trainee field agent who  enlists the help of   Anthony Hopkins' character who is a  cannibal, an imprisoned cannibal named  Doctor Hannibal Lecter. And  he  kind of takes a shining to her and  gives her little clues.  To investigate  a series of serial killings  happening in the United States. And  he does this  in order to  exchange information with her about her personal life   in order to   I don't know, figure her out. Because  he likes doing that, he likes  messing with people. And  yeah, this  movie  took home a lot of academy awards, it took home  best picture of nineteen ninety one, and best director Jonathan Demme, and  Jodie Foster best actress Jodie Foster and best supporting actor Anthony Hopkins. Anthony Hopkins is, is  really awesome in this movie.  He  gives a great performance.  On this dvd  is a commentary track, a very good commentary track by Jonathan Demme , Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Ted Tally the screenwriter, and FBI agent John Douglas. There's seven deleted scenes, there's some storyboards, a film to storyboard comparison,  an FBI  client, crime classification manual and  voices of death, word for word statements of convicted serial killers, which is pretty gross.  I didn't really enjoy reading that, who wants to hear what those freaks had to say. There's optimal image quality,  RSV dual layer edition. Unfortunately this edition is non-anamorphic, so if you have a widescreen television you're not going to get optimal picture quality despite what this thing says. Anyway, this is definitely a very good edition of this movie to have. I haven't checked out the other ones so I don't know if any of them are better than this one. But I own this one and I can  attest to the fact that this is a good movie. Not only is a good movie, it's a good edition of the movie and I highly recommend it.	6.164
Oh   Hi Expo TV I am here to review the DVD of  a great comedy from the early nineties Groundhog Day. Starring Bill Murray  and Andie MacDowell and  directed by Harold Ramis who started with Bill Murray and stripes  seven years before  this is one of my favorite comedies of the last say twenty years  it's a very simple premise done extremely well, and the simple premise is that a man gets stuck re-living the same day over and over again until he gets it right  in this case it's a weather man  played by Bill Murray who gets stuck in Groundhog Day in Puxatony, Philadelphia or excuse me Puxatony, Pennsylvania  until he gets the day right.   Somehow they found a way to make each new iteration of the day  different, fresh and it never gets boring in fact  as you go on you wait more and more to see  the familiar scenes play out in a different way and that's a lot of that credit goes to the script a lot of that credit goes to Bill Murray  and Andie Macdowell for keeping things fun.  Chris Elliott does a really nice supporting job in here as the camera man  I would really recommend getting this DVD  and if you rent it, or buy it, or whatever you do   You've got to listen to the Harold Ramis commentary track it's very informative,  very funny tell's you a lot about the movie  little tidbits like  they assumed while they're making the movie that  Bill Murray is is  stuck in this day for about ten years. So you get a sense of how long this is going on, even though you see maybe fifteen  versions of the day throughout the movie he's stuck in it much longer so you get a much greater sense of it. Anyways it's funny, it's smart  it's a great script well executed highly recommend Groundhog Day for a night of laughs.	6.055
Okay ExpoTv, it's a DVD review  it's really bad. It's Dungeons and Dragons on DVD. It's  like don't watch it. It's not good at all.  I don't know why they made it. It wasn't entertaining, it wasn't even like the funny kind of bad.  I guess for the plus side   it's got two audio commentaries and two documentaries and deleted scenes and  special effects deconstruction. But why would you want to watch any of that when the movie is absolutely horrible. So  {noise}  how do they finance this, who said, who who  was like, Dungeons and Dragons that's a good movie. Marlon Wayans, yeah let's get him in there, he's he's  great at these serious roles. Who, Dungeons and Dragons shouldn't have been made a, oh man, what's next, like Risk the movie?  Okay, so  time for the rating. Zero out of five. Zero out of ten. Yeah. Dungeons and Dragons, don't watch it unless you're an idiot.   It's harsh words but it's really not good, I'm I'm  bummed out I just watched it and wasted my night. Don't watch this movie. Why do I own it?	6.164
Hey expotv land. It's me, Danny Ericson, and I'm here to review the movie Alvin and the Chipmunks  with Jason Lee. This is   a newer adaptation with computer animation of the old TV show Alvin and the Chipmunks where there's three  chipmunks who sing music and perform, become an overnight sensation and  if I had the choice I would not watch this movie ever again because it's really cheesy and even cheesier than I thought it would be and it really didn't even, wasn't fun like the original was, the original TV show. So  just really wasn't what I, didn't have the same feel that I hoped that the original TV show had and it's just probably not even that fun of a movie for the family to watch. Kids, younger kids, don't even relate to that TV show. So I would say if you have the choice to go to it,  don't go cause it's kind of just a disappointment. But   so yeah.  Enjoy, you might it if you like the old TV show but I was disappointed, so.	5.099
Hello Expo, this is my  video review for the movie Meet the Spartans.    I came into the movie with very low expectations.  Like,  I knew it wasn't gonna be good.  Since the trailer.  I heard that people thought it was gonna be like, really hilariously funny and they're not really smart. If they thought that way. And I watched it because I had nothing else better to do. Anyway,   the movie is a parody of three hundred and a parody of other   movies and celebrities like Shrek, little bit of Happy Feet,  You Got Served.  Paris Hilton and other  stuff. And  there were probably  two or three  things that were kind of entertaining for me which is a surprise  cuz I expected much of my expectations were much lower than two or three laughs. Cuz like I was expecting  like, I was gonna stare at wallpaper kind of movie. And but there were some  scenes that were,  that went over the top with trying to make it humorous by, and,   it ended up just being disturbing or disgusting. And  lucky for me I have a way to like, shut that off like, if I know like a really horrible scene's gonna come up I'm just gonna like, go into my zone.  Or whatever. And  I give this movie a two out of five because it's  a bad movie, that's no surprise. Even if you haven't seen the movie you should know it's a bad movie. But it's not as bad  as I thought it would be.  You know. So,  that's my review of the movie Meet the Spartans.	4.082
Hi, I want to take a moment right now and do a DVD film review for Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween.  This probably compared to some of the other remakes was a little more original. It   follows the story line from the original Halloween   very well in my opinion.  The thing I liked about the film  is    Rob Zombie kind of goes in a little bit more to tell a little bit of the story, the background of the child of Michael Myers and what made him into the murderer that he was when he grew up.  It's Rob Zombie  so of course you're gonna have, you know,  some dark, dark  sides to the, to the   story but , you know, it was it was  a really awesome movie. It   had like some cameos from some people. It has  the individual who played Peter in the original Dawn of the Dead.   I don't know the guy, the name of the guy that played Doctor Lumis.  I thought he, he  did a  really good portrayal of the original Lumis. The  story line, again, it goes pretty much  once he is an adult it goes pretty similar to the original story, but you have I think about a good forty-five, fifty minutes where the story line is just  focusing on the child of Michael Myers. And  it's, it's   Rob Zombie so you know it's it's  a little bloody and it's a little gruesome. But  the film all in all, you know, I I  really liked it. I thought it was a great remake and it's definitely worth checking out.  And I think it's probably Rob Zombie's best film yet. And again  if you haven't seen this film may I suggest you do. And this is again a film review, DVD review for Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween, the unrated version.	4.082
Hello expotv. Today I'd like to review for you This Is Spinal Tap on DVD. Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer star as heavy metal band Spinal Tap in this mockumentary by Rob Reiner.  This movie is set up like a behind the scenes look at the lives on and off stage of one of England's most legendary bands.   The movie's done so well that it often leaves even diehard music fans pondering its reality.  Real musicians from Black Sabbath, Alice Cooper, Aerosmith have seen this movie and they've said, straight up, "god this is a ridiculous life of a rock star". They hit so many things  so well  that it makes  it seem so real. And like I said, you know, there's parts in this where you're like, you know, this isn't shocking, you hear about these things all the time, it's just extra funny cause it pushes that little, that little  much.  You know if you've ever seen the movie you'll know it takes it to eleven.  Highly recommend.  It's got over an hour and forty-five minutes of extras.  It's sure to please, especially if you're into this genre of music, if you're into hard rock and heavy metal it kind of pokes and prods and makes fun of it and it, and it's  very tongue in cheek. If you liked  Dewey Cox, you know, Walk Hard or you're into other movies like the Rutles movie or the Blues Brothers it's kind of the same vein and I highly recommend this movie to you.  Thank you.	6.683
Hello expotv, this is Dugan and I'm reviewing the movie Three-Hundred. And this is an excellent movie.   It is very driving, very fast, and very bloody.  If you can't handle blood then don't watch it, but if you can then it is very inspiring and  many women like it because of the very strong men. {laugh} Naked, almost, men. And {laugh} the men like it because there is lots of violence and strength and all that. So it's   a great movie, we watched it before basketball games and it's like   it's an inspiration kind of to us. It would  get us more excited for the game.   And what it's about is it's it's  about King Leonidas leading  his army of three-hundred Spartans who are supposedly the best warriors in the world, he is leading them against the great Persian army and against King Xerxes. And  it's a great movie, great ending, great plot, everything.  I like it a lot, the only problem is if you don't like the gore then you probably shouldn't watch it. And it's not recommendable for anybody under about  fourteen or fifteen. It's pretty,  it's pretty  gruesome so. It's a good movie though. Thank you.	3.786
Hello Expo TV. Today I have for you a review of a movie currently in theaters the Bee Movie.   In my opinion the Bee Movie is exactly that, a B movie. B here standing for bad.   In some ways I look at this movie as  an attempt, I don't know by either   the actors in the movie or the company who produced it to get back on it's feet or something it didn't really.  It was supposed to be a comedy, an animation and perhaps a kids movie and it was that. It was a kids movie. It wasn't very funny. It wasn't very entertaining.   It really didn't   add anything and give anything know to you know  cinematography     It's basically just what the title says, a bad movie, a B movie  and I really do think that. I give it two out of five stars.  Perhaps you know,  two out of five instead of one out of five because I did laugh sometimes.  It just didn't do it for me though. It was  it was all in all a bad movie. I would not recommend it. Two out of five stars, the Bee Movie.	5.354
Hi. I'm Chris and this is a review of the DVD for the movie  The Hulk.   This movie came out a couple of years ago and I have to say that it wasn't at all what I expected and I was a little bit  disappointed with this movie.  I was expecting sort of a   big screen version of the   eighties television series  The Incredible Hulk  the one that starred  Lou Ferrigno as the Incredible Hulk.  I was always a big fan of that growing up and I really liked that show. This movie focuses definitely more on the comic book side of the character the Hulk.   He's definitely  larger, larger than life type of superhero slash monster.  Whereas in the TV series he was accessible and  a lot more human than he is in this movie.  As far as stars go, not really a lot of big name stars. Although Nick Nolety is in this movie. I'm not really sure he managed to stumble into this. {clears throat}  Sam Elliot is in this,  he's always good and Jennifer Connely is in it as well. The star is  Eric Bana.  He's not really a well-known actor that they got to play the  lead character here. It's directed by Ang Lee, an excellent director  of  comic book type movies.  He's done that before.  So I wasn't really thrilled with this. I guess  if you were a big fan of the comic book character of The Hulk you might enjoy this more than I did but  I was actually looking for something else. As far as the DVD goes itself, this is a two disc set.  On the second disc are a bunch of  deleted scenes and also a level for the Xbox game,  stuff about the motion capture suit. It's fairly interesting but it's  nothing spectacular. That's The Hulk on DVD. Thanks.	5.0
Hi,  I'm Sara and I'm here tonight to tell you about The Shawshank Redemption.   This movie came out in the nineteen nineties. It was adapted from a novel by Stephen King. It's starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman and the year it came out, it was nominated for seven Academy Awards.  This movie is  one of my absolute favorites. Definitely top three. It is just a terrific movie all around.  It was nominated, as I said, for seven academy awards, including best picture.  And the movie is about Tim Robbins character who ends up going to prison and meeting a whole bunch of lively characters and about his time there.  It's just a terrific movie. It is a drama but there's just  something about it. There's just so much hope in it and it's just very kind of deep movie that makes you think and it's just a terrific movie. So if you have not seen it, see this please see it. Please buy it, you just have to have it for your collection.	4.83
What's up Expo Ben Mazo here again, today I'm reviewing the movie of Save the Last Dance. Starring Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas. I didn't enjoy this movie at all. So if I was you, I would not buy this or rent this, it's just a waste of money. It's  it's just pretty much a chick flick about dance and drama.   I am, I'm just not into those type of movies I mean that's just me but, if you like dance and drama movies go for it. I mean, I don't know. And  pretty much just about  this girl who wants to just be a dancer and everything and she meets a friend and he helps her out and everything but. Not going to ruin the plot for you or anything but I don't I don't even know if I should just ruin the plot because it's not that great of a movie, I don't even want you to see it. But I don't know, I'm giving it one out of five stars for this movie. Not a very good movie, so   don't pick it up today I guess.   I mean if you like Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas I guess you could try it, I don't know. I didn't like it but  I'll let, everyone has their own opinion so.  Save the Last Dance, one out of five stars.  Later.	3.109
I am reviewing Stephen King's The Mist and it's now currently playing in theaters. This movie was, it was okay.  I mean I like Stephen King stories   but this movie wasn't scary. Usually scary movies are filled with psychological terror and stuff, but this one was just shows you a bunch of monsters. It  the story line is basically  a mist attacks, like, an island,  a small island  and a bunch of people crowd into a grocery store to try and avoid the mist and, and  I won't spoil the end but the ending was  {noise} kind of touching I guess,  but  the ending was okay.  Nicely planned,  just the fact that they ended up showing all the monsters that were in the mist  just made it  it it  just wasn't scary anymore. I don't know if you can call it a horror since the monsters weren't really scary. They were just basically like giant bugs and giant lobsters.  But if you want a cheap laugh I guess.	4.082
Hello. Today I would like to review for you a movie currently in theaters called Mad Money. It stars Ted Danson, Queen Latifah, and  Diane Keaton.    It's basically, it's a light comedy. It's sort of like an adult contemporary comedy.   It's about  these three women that that  work for the national reserve and  they're just like, you know, normal women, they're not like   thieves or gangsters or anything like that. They're just, you know, your normal everyday women. And they're plotting to steal  this money that's going to be destroyed by the national reserve cause  of course the national reserve controls the money and, you know, sometimes money just has to be destroyed. So  they plot to steal this money for themselves and,  you know, comedy ensues. So it's, like I said it's a light comedy so  it was, when the movie was over I was somewhat pleased and entertained but it was sort of one of those take it or leave it kind of things.  It's a very forgettable film and like the casting isn't that great. Like Ted Danson is in it so, I mean, if that says anything then  I know you know what I'm talking about, but yeah.  Mad Money, , it's okay. If you're in the mood for a light comedy, if there's nothing else playing at the theater. Otherwise it's not really worth, you know, nine or ten bucks or whatever it costs to see a movie at your theater.	4.69
{cough} Hi, I'm Mike with expotv and this is my movie review of The Hottie and the Nottie. And this is  easily one of the worst films ever created.  For those of you not familiar with it, it is  features Paris Hilton and I believe she received top billing, so she is the star of the movie.  She plays a girl who  years ago, when she was about six or seven years old, had a mutual crush on a little boy about the same age.  And we now grow up  twenty, twenty-five years later, and  we pick up the story where that boy goes back to find her and realizes that she is beautiful or perfect in his eyes but, and she would be considered the hottie, but there is a nottie who is not hot, for those of you not up on these terms. And it is a girl wearing obviously bad makeup,  bad hair, bad fat suit, all this kind of stuff and the minute you see her you can tell that somewhere underneath there a makeover is going to occur. So  it's just coming down the turnpike.  This movie should be avoided like the plague, it's completely awful.  All the  the writers  should be indicted  and all the actors ,  you know,  tortured to some extent. So definitely avoid this film at all costs. I'm Mike with expotv.	5.0
Hello, expo. I'd like to tell you about a movie called The Hottie and the Nottie. This is a movie starring Paris Hilton. The only thing that really saves this movie is that Paris has her clothes on.  It's really a terrible, terrible movie and it shows that, once again, Paris has to be in front of the camera. She's very narcissistic in doing that because, after all the trouble she's been in and after all the terrible  X-rated that movies she's been in, I'm real, not even, I don't even understand why she would want to be in a movie. Why I went to see this? Actually it was a matinee, so I paid around five dollars to see it. Actually, it wasn't worth a dollar to see. I suppose I was just curious to see if she could redeem herself. She's not an actress. She. The story plot's lame. It's a silly really it . She's supposed to be the gorgeous girl that a school mate has had a   long-time crush on. Her girlfriend is supposed to be  uglier than ugly and can't find a date.  Paris decides that she will not date anyone until she can find a date for her girlfriend, so she goes to all means to make her girlfriend   accessible and that's basically is the plot of the story. We do see a lot of Paris, but thank goodness she has her clothes on. That's really the only good thing I can say about it. She should be ashamed for even showing xxx herself in the movies because, to me, she's not a pretty girl, with or without her clothing and this movie is not good at all.	6.683
Hi expotv land. It's me, Danny Ericson, and I'm here to talk to you about this great new movie called The Hottie and the Nottie, starring Paris Hilton  and  Joel Moore.  This is just a great movie.  Just had great themes in it. I  it's about this guy called Nate who is   Who is  who has liked this girl since he was a little boy and he's had a lot of other girlfriends but he's finally realized that Paris Hilton is the one for him. So he tracks her down but realizes that there's this girl that's really ugly that    that Paris Hilton's always hanging out with and that she won't go on a date without her friend who's ugly but then he  then so he's trying to find all these guys to go on dates with her. But  it turns out it's one of the best movies of the year and I would say definitely go and watch it if you're planning on having the worst time of your life. Paris Hilton in a movie? Please, come on. This is not a good movie. I don't think you should watch it. One out of ten, if that.  I'm sorry Paris Hilton but you really can't make movies.	5.972
Hello Expo TV. Tonight I would like to share with you Men Seeking Women, starring Will Ferrel and a couple other horribly unfunny people.   I highly advise you stay as far away  from this movie as you can. It's one of those things where  a company has a movie with someone in it and they realize that person is now famous so they pull it out and put it on DVD to trick people into buying it because it has someone they love, being Will Ferrel.  It has him right there on the cover,  twice, in the picture and standing here. He's all over the back, because no one else cares about the other people in this movie.  It has the little smarmy glasses wearing guy from Murphy Brown.   It's just not awesome. It's about these best friends  and there's something about them trying to get married in a certain amount of time. I honestly can't even tell you that I watched the movie all the way through. It made me sick to my stomach.   Like I said it's cheap, I think it runs like five bucks which is why I picked it up, I should of known better. But   consider this a warning to avoid Men Seeking Women.  Will Ferrel the parts that I watched you know he's kind of funny but the writing in it's terrible and they don't really give him much to work with and it seems like he kind of may have had a jerk director that wouldn't let him you know do his thing and experiment and play around and  be as    improvious as he would want to be. So I highly recommend you stay as far away from Men Seeking Women as you possibly can.	5.745
Hi, I'm here to review the movie The House of Yes. Starring Parker Posey, Josh Hamilton,  Tori Spelling, Freddie Prinz Junior.  This was a movie about an eccentric rich family living in Massachussetts who are  obsessed by the Kennedys.  Josh Hamilton plays the son, he's bringing his fiance to meet his family for the first time.   His his  mother tries to buy her off  but it's his sister Parker Posey who is  completely obscene, {laughs} or not obscene, insane and obsessed  by her brother who probably most frightens us  in this movie.  The movie is billed as a dark comedy but   I didn't really find it all that funny, I found it kind of ridiculous and    maybe bizarre. If if  that's a good word.  I think the best line in the movie comes from Tori Spelling when she looks at Parker Posey and says no you're not insane you're just incredibly spoiled.  The House of Yes a rounding no. A rousing no.	4.83
Ten thousand B.C.  I'm not sure what I miss more, the five dollars I spent to go see it or the two hours I spent watching it.   This movie was absolutely abysmal, is the only word I can think of to describe it.   Just the first line of the movie was just, it was just ridiculous. It was     The only err only time will tell the difference between legend and truth, and you're just like, what the heck does that even mean? Does that Mean that this whole movie is just a lie?  Anyways,  this movie follows the story of  this one guy who's like the chosen ,you know, guy, to like overthrow these Egyptians. I don't, it's really unclear, as they go from like Himalayas to like, a rain forest to a desert in like three days, just walking. And it's just  it's, it's  really ridiculous and then there's there's . Okay there's this one part where like, where he's in like, this pit, and there's like a saber-toothed tiger in there and he was just like, I'm gonna kill you. Aww but wait, you're sort of trapped in these sticks,  I'm not gonna kill you so don't kill me. And the saber-toothed tiger is like, alright that's cool.  I don't know. Anyways, the xxx in it like, weren't even that cool and I mean there were like,  mammoths, CGI mammoths that were sorta neat I guess. It wasn't visually that stunning.  The girl wasn't even like that attractive.  It was just an overall disappointment but, I mean it was funny to see just cause we could make fun of it afterwards. But other than that,  sort of a waste of time and money. Yeah, ten thousand B.C.	5.0
Hi, I'm Mike with expotv and this is my movie review of College Road Trip, which was a complete utter waste of time.  Ever since the American Pie movies came out around ten years ago  people have been coming up with movies like Road Trip and College Road Trip, all this type of  different stuff. Well this one basically stars  Martin Lawrence and he's reconnecting with his daughter who's getting ready to go to college.  And because Martin Lawrence is in it  it's kind of funny because he's he's  a seasoned, funny, professional guy  but the movie is just watered down. It's got that  really awful RV meets Are We There Yet type of vibe to it where it's so family oriented, it has such, such  moments every five or ten minutes of just unfunny stupidity that it's just a real challenge to enjoy.   I would say I can't really think of anybody that might  enjoy the movie.   If if  you were sleeping or comatose in the film you might enjoy it.  If you were in the bathroom during the whole film , you know, you might like it too but if you're forced to watch it then you're pretty much not gonna enjoy it at all.   I definitely think Martin Lawrence needs to go back to some other funny things.  It's kind of sad but, you know, you probably thought a year or two ago when you saw , if you did see, Wild Hogs you'd probably think "well wow, he can't get any lower" but he actually did.  So maybe he needs to go back and do Wild Hogs Two or just do something to get his career back on track, but but  this is just a big mess.  I'm Mike with expotv and I thank you for your time.	5.354
Hi. My name is Mike, and this is my ExpoTV movie review of the film Over Her Dead Body, which is a movie that I guess  I I  don't know, words really can't describe. It wasn't very good. It might make a good date movie.  But basically, the plot  is just kind of, it seemed sort of TV movie-ish, like  like something that even Lifetime might even reject. But basically in it, you have  Eva Longoria Parker, from Desperate Housewives, and she plays a bride that accidentally gets killed on her wedding day and  her fiance slash husband from that wedding day is Paul Rudd. And  he  basically takes it pretty hard, as most of us would.  And then  what happens from there is he decides to go consult a psychic and go sort of deal with the with the  whole situation in therapy. And, as you might expect, the psychic is an attractive female, because it is movieland, and he starts to fall in love with her.  And then  from the grave, Eva Longoria Parker decides to  torture him and, and  try and break them up and everything.  And it it involves a lot of scenes where she  is sort of, like, hovering over them or watching him and her as the new romance develops and stuff. So  it all wraps up  toward the end as you might expect. I won't give anything away. But  just overall, it's just a painful exercise to watch, not a really good movie, something that you should steer clear of  even if  I'm not a fan of Desperate Housewives, but even even   the the  person that I went with  she is, and she even hated the movie. So just overall just steer clear of this movie.  If you have to entertain yourself this weekend,  buy a puzzle, maybe dogs playing poker, put it together or something, you know. But don't go see this movie.	5.745
What's up Expo, I have a movie review for you, it's Step Up two the Streets. Came out February two thousand eight. It was directed by Jon by Jon Chu. Basically it's like the romance, but with like dancing involved.   It doesn't have like the like like    Channing Tatum's not in it which pretty much made Step Up I cause like  because like the storyline was decent. But this one it's just like, not that good. People in it are like Robert Hoffman and other like people that I've never even heard of before.  I wasn't too impressed with the movie.   It really really wasn't that good. It's It's  just like  like they go to the same school and like dancing brings them together.  But this sequel, not good. It's not a good sequel at all. I do not recommend seeing this movie. So I would have to give Step Up two the Streets a two out of five for this terrible sequel.	3.873
Hi guys.  Today I'll be talking about the movie Semi-Pro.  This movie is the latest release  in which Will Ferrell is the main leading character.  Supposed to be a comedy movie but it's not much comedy. I enjoyed Will Ferrell's last movie Blades of Glory but this movie's  not up to that mark of comedy.   In this movie  Will Ferrell is the coach and the star player of the American Basketball Association team.  The name of the team was the Tropics and then  and there was a competition if their team xxx xxx xxx that then their team would be totally  like moshed into some other team. So, he basically had to push all all  of his players to play a good nice game. But  mean, it it  was  not that interesting movie. So,  I'm probably gonna give this movie  like two out of five.   That's it for Semi-Pro.	4.359
Hello.  For my review today I'll do Semi-Pro, the Will Ferrell new comedy out in theaters. I caught this about two days ago in the evening, I went to my local theater with my friend and both of him and myself were big fans of, like, Old School and even Ricky Bobby  and Blades of Glory were okay. But I'll have to admit for this review that Semi-Pro xxx on the same kind of comedy and jokes all the rest of them worked on, but it's almost getting a little stale. I hate to say it cause I love Will Ferrell but  the jokes are all kind of the same you've seen before. He's attacked by an animal in one scene, the downtrodden like, you know, ABA team you've got to win games to rally the crowd and the team and  I don't know. You you  want to like Will Ferrell but my reviews have to be mixed but negative. I don't want to say skip it or, you know why not get it as a rental later on? It may not be worth the full ten dollars or nine dollars they charge for a movie nowadays. As the price gets up there I have to be more and more picky about what I go to and this one I probably wouldn't go to again. There are some funny moments but they're far and few between. So  Will Ferrell Semi-Pro I might recommend you just see this at home instead of in the theater. You know what? Maybe the next one Will Ferrell.	5.0
My name is Eric Nederland.  And I am reviewing the movie Twenty-Seven Dresses for Expo Tv dot com.  Yes.  I did see this movie.  Not by my own choice, I was forced to.  It was everything you might expect from such a movie. Romantic comedy, about a woman who has been a bridesmaid twenty-seven times.  Now,   I don't know about you,   but I don't think I'm going to be a wedding attendant twenty-seven times and I don't know how many people really will be. That in itself was a little bit unbelievable. But unfortunately that was one of the more believable plot points.  Now, I don't have anything against the actors, the director, I just don't think it was a movie that was worth being made.  Everything was romantic comedy-ish.  It was cliched. Unbelievable leaps of  the imagination you have to suspend your disbelief like,  I don't know.  Like an elephant was stepping on your pants.  If you like that sort of thing,  go see it.  If not,  run the other direction as fast as you can.	5.0
Hey, y'all. It's the king of movies here, and today I'm going to review ten thousand BC,  which recently came out in theaters. It's  from the director of Independence Day and the Day After Tomorrow. And  while I found those films , particularly Independence Day, to be pretty good,    ten thousand BC fails in that department.  It's about basically a, a  tribe of people who,  you know, like someone who  one, one  person gets  like a princess kind of deal happens where  she gets kidnapped and basically the tribe goes out to rescue her and then they meet other tribes and a whole kind of war happens.  I thought the ending especially was,  was pretty horrible.  I don't want to ruin it, but  they, let's just say that they tried to surprise the audience all of the sudden with  a kind of     just just  new  introduction of new characters, and I thought that was fairly week and disappointing.   It's,  it's been getting  pretty negative reviews by the press, but I tried to go into it with an open mind,  particularly because I liked Independence Day and  unfortunately it failed. The CGI,  there was a lot of CGI. Some of it's good. Some of it's kind of bad.  There, it just wasn't my cup of tea. Wasn't well executed, pretty formulaic, bad ending, wouldn't recommend watching it. And that's my review of ten thousand BC.	4.082
Hey y'all. It's the king of movies here and today I'm going to  review Step Up Two the Streets which is a new movie in theaters.  It's a teen,  teen kind of drama about   {burp} excuse me, dancing.   If you're interested at all in dancing  like  street, excuse me, street style dancing  like   You Got Served and that kind of dancing you might enjoy this film.   I thought it was pretty formulaic and   just like typical teen melodrama stuff that we've been seeing  for the last several years.  Just like regurgitated stuff. However I must admit that the choreographed dance scenes are  quite a sight to see and they're really top notch. If you're a fan of dancing in that sense, just like to watch people dance, see impressive dance moves then you might want to check out this movie solely for that. The actual plot, however, is formulaic and not really worth seeing. It's kind of one of those movies where  it's stretched out to ninety minutes just to be a full length movie but it would have been perfectly fine just showing the the  choreographed  dance scenes, like a ten minute short or like something on TV, or even just like put someone put up a clip on youtube of just people dancing. It's it's  that kind of movie where they just stretch it out with an unnecessary plot that's formulaic and  try to turn it into a movie and it it  ultimately fails in in  the sense of a movie. Wouldn't recommend seeing it in theaters   just because the plot and stuff like that is all just regurgitated and  formulaic. Instead   watch the dance scenes. Hopefully one day, when the DVD comes out or something, you'll be able to just easily watch it on youtube or  rent it even, just to see the dance scenes because the rest of the movie is just there kind of to fill up space and make it ninety minute, minute   feature length.   So if you're, so that's  Step Up Two the Streets.  If you're interested in dancing you might maybe check it out. If you have, if you hate dancing there's no point in even checking this out really cause the plot sucks and   the dancing is only there for people that enjoy dancing. And that's my review of Step Up Two the Streets.	2.708
Hey Expo TV.  Today I'm here to talk about the movie Blind Mountain.   This movie's about something you rarely rarely hear about.  This is about   the slave trafficking, in  in particular Asia.   This movie's about   young individual who is captured and sold as a sexual slave.  This is something that goes on with reasonable frequency  especially in Eastern Asia.  This boy is taken to a remote village in China and he kinda really sees no support from anywhere. He's kind of trapped  in this horrible, horrible cycle  with with  no way out it seems.  And the movie's really kind of just about white slavery or Asian slavery.   Instead of, you normally hear about  American slavery of the African Americans.  But this movie kind of takes another direction and kind of opens your eyes to different issues in the world.  As a movie overall, I thought the acting was poor.  The story could have been filmed a lot better I think, because it's very interesting. I just think it's hard to make that work into a cohesive  watchable  story.  So the story was definitely very poor how they did it.   If it was purely    If it was purely historical, I think it would work.  Maybe to be shown in schools, something like that. But as a movie,  it definitely falls short. So I'm gonna say one out of five stars, as a movie. As more of a documentary  which it's not in that genre, but if it were, I would say three out of five stars.	6.683
Hey, ExpoTV. Today I'm here to talk about the movie Boarding Gate.  Watching this movie is probably one of the biggest wastes of my time  in recent memory.  I should have known that going in, but I didn't listen.  What this movie is about is Asia Argento, who plays an ex-prostitute.  And she's forced  to flee England,  London  after a {sigh} bad encounter  during one of her jobs. And , as you can tell, the movie is already completely ridiculous and not something you want to watch.  But she's forced to flee, and she takes up with a different couple. And, you know, they promise to get her her  passport, her visa, all the necessary papers  obviously in exchange for services.  And it basically turns out to be a manipulation on the couple's end against Sandra.   So a completely ridiculous story.  No value in watching this at all. You don't learn anything from this movie. You don't get a good feeling afterwards.  After watching it, I just felt a little bit sick, a little bit disgusted, like why did I just waste my time watching that?  So I think most people would get that feeling after seeing this. Like I said, there's really nothing that sticks out that would be even remotely good about this movie.  Even the acting is poor.  So thumbs way down for Boarding Gate, one out of five stars.	6.055
Hello, today I'm going to review  Semi-Pro starring Will Ferrell this is a movie that's basically a vehicle for more crazy Will Ferrell zany antics  he's playing a basketball player this time and that's basically all the plot there is to it. It really has no plot, just an excuse for Will Ferrell to do  crazy dumb things and   basically I think Will Ferrell might be out of schtick   all of his movies have been kind of dropping off into being repetitive and dumber and dumber and this one is probably the worst movie he's ever made. This has happened to a lot of the Saturday Night Live alum and   speaking of Saturday Night Live movies it's just to give you an idea, I would say of all the bad movies that have ever come out of their characters this one would probably just barely beat Ladies Man. This is a really bad movie, it has no plot whatsoever and I really had high hopes for it because at his best Will Ferrell can be  apparently zany and funny, but spent a lot of money advertising  this movie, had multiple spots during the superbowl. They even put the semi-pro character into the sports illustrated swimsuit edition. You really couldn't get away from it and then you see the movie and really, really disappointing and it kind of think if it spent some money on writing instead of advertising it might have been a little bit better.  The  title Superbad hadn't already been taken recently I think that would have been a much better title for this movie, this movie's terrible I give it one star and give it a one half a star if that was an option, it's really bad don't go see it.	5.0
Hi I'm Tom and today I'm gonna be reviewing the movie Superhero Movie. Before I begin this is what I need to do.  {slaps palm on forehead}  Ok, I'll explain why in a minute, but as always  I hold on to it, here's the movie ticket. I'm ashamed I have this. Alright, I don't know why I went to see this. I really shouldn't have. I should've learned my lesson from four Scary Movies, Epic Movie,  Date Movie. I should've learned my lesson. No, I like slapstick though. So I figured, okay this could be good, it's got Leslie Nielson in it again and he always amuses me every single time.  And yes he was funny in this one. Airplane's amazing,  yeah that's why I just like him so much. Okay this kind of has Drake Bell in his first starring role, the Nickelodeon icon or whatever. Hannah Montana, Nickelodeon, okay maybe not.  He  gets into a freak accident and turns into the new clumsy superhero know as Dragonfly.  Okay, that's about it for the plot. Yes, it is in depth as a paper bag.  Look I got an apple.  Okay the slapstick in it is funny. As always, it's not worth spending as much as I did to go see this. I just had a few friends who wanted to see this, I'm like alright fine, I'll go. If you get into that situation, don't do it. Learn from my mistake. As  as I had to slap myself over the head, I should have learned from  the first eight mistakes. somewhere in there.    It's, as I said it's slapstick funny. Makes fun of all  superhero movies, at least for the most part.  What more can you really say about a really dumb movie.  Stick with Airplane, Leslie Nielson, you did that one great. You're funnier than the rest of em.  Please don't tag on to horrible movies cause then I'll go see them. I wasted so much on this. Don't go see this.  Wait for it to become a budget renter. Not even a budget theater. Not even a regular rental, wait for the rental to be there so long it's now cheaper. Go for those. Just wait for that long if you actually want to see this movie. That's my advice.  One out of five. Thank you.	5.745
Hi, today I'm going to do a movie currently in theaters for view for you of a movie called ten thousand B.C.  ten thousand B.C. is about  you know, it takes place in ten thousand B.C.  A prehistoric culture  and it kind of revolves around a young man who is hunting mammoths and  trying to save his tribe. This movie though, this movie is absolutely awful. I   I couldn't recommend this to anybody. There's all kinds of things going around that don't seem to actually make any sense, especially in regards to historical accuracy.  Number one, you've got you know pyramids being built, you've got vultures on like mammoths and you've got people of different kinds of  races sometimes, it's just like  ten thousand B.C., this is not probable.  It's not true  and  the movie is really terrible. They don't develop into the characters at all.  Throughout the duration of the movie I don't feel a sense to any of the characters. And also the acting is just some of the worst acting I've ever seen. And If I could say this   {laugh} just  save your money. Save your eight, nine, ten dollars. Whatever the movie rate is in your city and do not go see ten thousand B.C. There's probably a lot of other movies playing right now that you would enjoy more than ten thousand B.C. So again,  this is my review for ten thousand B.C. Do not go see it, it's really awful.	5.26
What's up Expo. I've got a Denzel Washington movie right here, Out of Time.  Didn't like this movie. I'm a huge Denzel fan. I love every Denzel movie I think he's an amazing actor. And he, he  is a good actor in this movie.    Like he plays his character well. It's not  that, I just don't like the movie. The movie's terrible. He plays his character good. He still  is an amazing actor.  But this movie was not very good.  It's got Eva Mendes in it though, which is, she's beautiful you know that. And Sanaa Lathan from Blade, and Dean Cain from Lois and Clark and Ripley's Believe It Or Not. So if you're into any of those, those  people I mean check it out. I didn't like it but that doesn't mean you won't.   It's a cop story. Denzel's the, the good guy. Look at him on the cover. He's the good guy but. I just, I wasn't feeling Out of Time. Maybe you will though.	3.742
Hi guys.   Today I am going to talk about a new released movie, Superhero movie.  This is a spoof movie of Spider Man but you can also say something, something  into account like X-man and  some other movies.   This spoof movie is like   not that much interesting because    I don't like spoof movie that much but  I like the movies  Meet the Spartans but this movie doesn't  I I  don't like this movie much.  It seems story about a guy who was bitten by  xxx bitten by a dragonfly, got superpower  but   xxx he he  shows his power in some stupidity and    its  maybe I can say  two out of five and would not recommend you to watch this movie  and that's it.	2.944
Hey, ExpoTV. This is Aubs eighty four. Today, I'm going to talk about the movie, Nim's Island. And this stars Jodie Foster and Gerard Butler.  Many of you will recognize Gerard Butler from movies such as three hundred, where he played the main character in that film. He plays a little more of a bit part in this film, so if you're going to go rush out to see the movie for Gerard Butler, you're going to be disappointed. He plays the role of a a  father. Nim is the main character of the movie. She is a little girl who lives on this island with her father, Gerard Butler.   They're kind of secluded from everybody.  The father is a scientist who does a lot of research and needs a lot of time for his experiments, so he doesn't have a lot of time for his daughter, Nim. And to counter this, Nim has a lot of fanciful creatures that she's created. She has a very active imagination in this one.  She loves to read books. That's her favorite hobby. And her favorite author is played by Jodie Foster. And what happens is, Nim's father goes out to sea to do a experiment. A storm comes out. He gets lost out at sea. Nim writes her favorite author for some help, saying that her father's lost, what does she do, how does she get through life, I mean, what's her next step And Jodie Foster's character comes out to the island to hang out with Nim and try to help her cope and do things like that.  Now, this is not a very realistic story at all.  First of all, who lives on a deserted island, a deserted volcanic island, with  just a father and a daughter? Nobody does that. And especially when the father sails away to do science experiments and leaves Nim all by herself. I mean, she can't be more than, I don't know, twelve or thirteen. And for her to be alone on this island is ridiculous without a father or a babysitter, anything.  So that's the first  ridiculous part of the movie.  The next ridiculous part is that a letter written by a little girl to a famous author would actually solicit a visit. I mean, maybe the author would write back and say, you know, thanks for the letter, blah, blah, blah. But, no, the author actually comes out to the island to be with this little girl.  That's also ridiculous.   So it's not very believable. It's very fanciful , lots of crazy stuff going on in the way of imagination.  It's definitely a little kid's movie. And if you have a daughter or a son who is probably under the age of ten, I think they'd love it because there's some imaginary creatures. There's a little bit of action. It can be a little scary. I would say the storm scene might be a little frightening for some younger kids.  But it's just kind of a fun movie for the younger generation. And definitely if you're an adult, don't go in prepared to believe everything. I guess when I went to the film, I didn't know what to expect. I didn't know that this was supposed to be, you know, a joke and supposed to be all creative and imaginative. So I was expecting a lot, and I was disappointed. I'm only going to give it a one out of five stars because there's not a lot of redeeming quality to it.  One of the best scenes is just kind of a touchy moment  where, you know, a father and daughter have to say goodbye to one another. And, you know, if that's the best scene in the movie, I think that says a lot.  One out of five stars.	6.403
Hey, ExpoTV. This is Aub eighty four. Today I'm going to talk about the movie College Road Trip, starring Martin Lawrence and Raven Symone.  Before I go into character detail, I'll give you a little heads up about what the movie is about. Martin Lawrence plays a police officer who decides to go on a road trip with his daughter, playing by Raven Symone, to check out colleges. And he's very worried about the kind of trouble that she's going to get into when she's away at college  you know, drugs, sex, parties, things like that. So basically the movie revolves around how he tries to keep her away from these kinds of things while they're on the road trip, and he definitely is trying to pick out a college that is clean and well-run and not going to lead her astray.   Many of you will recognize Raven Symone. She was a child actor on a lot of TV shows.  She has a couple of movies out. And I was actually surprised to see how much she's grown up.  Obviously, she's of college age for this movie, and I think she does a much better job of acting now than she did when she was a kid,  maybe understandable, a little more training, a little more experience could do a lot.  Martin Lawrence is in his typical role, kind of a wise-cracking humor  lots of situational gags, some physical comedy.  I would say that if you've seen a Martin Lawrence comedy, you've seen this movie. It's very similar.  One of the best parts of the movie is a scene where  Martin Lawrence's character finds these coffee beans and he thinks they're drugs. And so he feeds them to this pig and the pig goes crazy on caffeine. So that was kind of a situational, physical, ha, ha, ha bit. And that was one of the funnier scenes of the movie, unfortunately. I guess there's just not much that hasn't been done for kind of the college road trip type deal. For instance, there's a movie called Road Trip, a movie called Eurotrip. And while those were all teenagers and, and  more a little about drugs and getting drunk and sex, it's still the kind of same humor, where people drive around and they say funny things and there's a parent you try to avoid because they will get you in trouble. And that just felt like the same thing for this movie. Definitely not one of my favorites. There wasn't anything new in terms of comedy. No real humor that really got me rolling or anything like that.  No special effects. Soundtrack is debatable.  There was one good song, many okay songs, and a couple songs I just wondered why they were even on the soundtrack, what a waste of my life.  I'm only going to give this movie a two out of five stars for all of those reasons. If you do have to see it, I would say rent it. Don't rush out to see it in the theaters. Not worth your money.	6.683
Hello, everyone. Playing over my shoulder is this. This is Freejack.  This is a terrible movie.  I first heard of this movie  when a friend of mine in grade school decided to  rip off its storyline for a  short story that he had written  in grade school. He  lifted  large elements of the plot. And  as he was explaining this in front of the class, I thought to myself, huh, that sounds an awful lot like Freejack. And   this movie storyline and his storyline are as follows:  Emilio Estevez plays a race car driver who  just as he is about to die in a  horrible race car driving accident, he, his  body is snatched into the future,  thanks to  a billionaire Anthony Hopkins. And   the reason Anthony Hopkins' character does that is so he can take his  mind and implant it into the body of Emilio Estevez's character, thus giving him eternal life or some nonsense.  Also in this movie is Rene Russo, who was in Lethal Weapons three and four, and the Thomas Crown Affair. And  also in this movie, in addition to her, is  Mick Jagger here, who was in The Rolling Stones and still is in The Rolling Stones. And his performance is terrible in this movie.  He has one facial expression, and it pretty much consists of this.  Anthony Hopkins is in this movie very, very barely.  I think for like the first half of the movie, at the very least, he's not even in the same room with any of the other main characters. He communicates with Rene Russo's character  via a  telecommunications device. And he's  either in, like, China or  France or something. And the backdrop is just some mad painting and it looks terrible. And  he really, really, sincerely, honestly phoned in his performance. I honestly think that in, in  like the final third of the movie, or whatever, in the latter half of the movie, I actually think it's more like the final third or the final quarter, when he actually is in the same room with Emilio Estevez and Rene Russo.  I, I  honestly think that they just used a body double for him so that he did not have to be in the same room with anyone else. And I think they just shot his coverage separately. It just has that feel to it.  Yeah, this is a, a really stupid movie, and me and my friends used to get together and  watch really awful movies like this and just talk over them and make fun of them. And  this is by far my favorite one. I think this was the last one that  that me and my friends in  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, watched before I moved to Chicago. And  I have fond memories of watching this tremendous piece of crap with  my friends before moving. So  if you are about to move, and you like making fun of crappy movies, I, I  can't recommend this movie highly enough.	5.745
ExpoTV, let's talk about Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns. All right? First of all, Tyler Perry, quit making stuff. Quit making TV shows. You're not funny. No one thinks you're funny. It's stupid. Let me tell you why. All right?  Now, the premise of the movie, Meet the Browns, is extremely stupid. I highly recommend going to see anything except for this movie. All right? The acting was not that good. The writing even wasn't that good. All right? All right, now, all right, the acting was okay, but the writing wasn't good, and there's nothing new about the screen shots, the cinematography. All right? There's, like, no reason to see it. There is not one reason to see this movie. In my opinion, I think you could spend your money and, more importantly, your time elsewhere or in a different  movie in the theater, or don't even go to movies. Go do something else, because this movie is not good. All right?  Seriously, whoever cast this movie, not good. And Tyler Perry, this is a message from me to you. Do not make movies, because they're not good. Everyone on ExpoTV, please do not see this movie. It's not worth your time. I highly recommend going to see something else.	6.403
Hey ExpoTV, this is a review on the movie Because of Winn-Dixie.  This disc.    It's, it's a very cute movie  the dog is really  it basically follows the book.  The book is one of my all-time favorites, the actress Anna Sophia, she is, she's really good, she's like the next Dakota Fanning, I think.  Southern, takes place down south, it's a very southern movie  everybody's got a little accent to them.  Dave Matthews is in it, which is basically the reason why I watched it. I love him in this movie.  I actually wished there were more Dave Matthews songs featured in the movie,  I thought there would be I was kind of disappointed that there weren't but the rest of the movie made up for it, it's very cute, very much like the book, no surprises, nothing crazy, nothing big.   I think it's a great movie to watch with the family, kids probably will love it   it's it's  good, it's a good movie . Lots of life lessons to learn. And I think it's one that every kid will enjoy. And any dog lover.	4.435
Hello. My name is Mike and today I'll be talking to you about the movie Ironman. As formality, here's my movie ticket.  And there we go. So, what did I think about Ironman?  Me and my buddy went to see it the other day because it was his birthday and that's what he wanted to see. Me coming in, I wasn't really that excited about seeing it. I figured I'd wait until the budget, which was sort of my incoming consensus of the movie. Yeah, that definitely wasn't true. I actually really liked the movie. After having seen it, yes, it was good. The basic premise of the movie, for those of you who don't know Ironman, this was a comic book character from back in the day. You know, it's still running, but, to the best of my knowledge, it's still running, but anyway this came from, actually, quite a ways back.   The basic story, comic book and movie here, would be scientist gets captured by enemy forces, in this case it's, you know, foreign terrorists-like people, and they try to force him to make super weapons to help them take over the world, yadda, yadda. But instead  Tony Stark, aka Ironman from that point on,  uses the technology that he's given to build a supersuit that he uses not only to escape, but then, later on, to fight evil.  So, you know, it's been changed a little bit to fit the movie. In the movie  he ends up fighting evil again after he's free of the terrorists, to try to sort of save the world from another plot.  It's a little sappy.  But at the same time, it's like, you know, what do you expect? I don't expect something from a movie that's, you know, got the plot quality of a really good book. I mean, you only have two hours to portray things to me. So it's a little sappy and the plots feel a little underdeveloped at times, but, I mean, hey, it's a superhero movie. What did you expect?  The guy,  Robert Downey, Jr., playing Ironman, excellent. He pulls it off perfectly. You could totally see him as the character.  So, him playing in the supersuit, it's it's  kind of interesting, because it's got elements where you're like, when you're watching, you're like, man, this is really funny and yet kind of dramatic at the same time, elements that are not often pulled off together. This definitely pulled it off well. And you're laughing while, at the same time, you're like watching them fight, and it's, and when I watched, like, the credits for the movie, you know, on TV before it came out there, they didn't ruin every single line in the movie. There's plenty of good stuff still left without the preview. So, Ironman, for having a good quality mixture of story, plot, funny, as well as a little bit of romance in there too, I'm going to give Ironman a five out of five. And then, to top it off, they even played Ironman at the end of the movie. So, Ironman, five out of five. You should totally go see it. Thank you and good night.	5.598
Hello there Expo TV viewers,  my name is Karl and I'm reviewing Ironman, , the film today. I went to go see it the other night, and it was a lot different than I expected. I expected it to be  more of a superhero movie than it was. , I really liked it though, I thought I thought  it did a great job. , It was sort of political which I wasn't unsuspecting, but welcomed.  It follows Tony Stark who is  the head of Stark industries, which is a weapons manufacturer.  This is all fictional of course.  and, , it's it's  based on the Marvel comic of the same name Ironman and, , Tony  gets capture by some , Afghani militants and he, they, they  force him to build this weapon, and he sort of secretly behind their backs builds this Iron Man suit, , and just bursts out of there and decides that he should really be using his weapons , for good instead of, sort of, just for killing purposes.   This was overall a very, very good movie. It was sort of long. It was like two and a half hours long.  But there's a little bit of a love story in it. There's   a lot of, there's not a lot of action but there's a fair amount of action. There's some really cool scenes where , he's in a suit and doing his Ironman things, and he's got like all that cool gadgets that  he's got on there. And there's a lot of like technical sciency stuff in there too if you're into that. So, overall I thought it was a really good movie.  So if you're interested in , superheros type stuff  go see Ironman. And if you're not, then, there's probably something in this movie for you anyways. Alright, till next time.	5.477
Hello everyone. Playing over my shoulder is this movie. This is Munich which was directed by Steven Spielberg.  It stars Eric Bana as a  the the  leader of a group of  Israelis who are given the task of killing the eleven Palestinians who  were responsible for the nineteen-seventy-two  Munich massacre of  eleven Israeli athletes. It was based on the  book Vengeance by George Jonas and  I really didn't like this movie that much. It  really didn't   involve me at any kind of, you know, serious emotional level.  It's supposed to be about the  the toll that murder takes on, you know, normal people and  again, I I  like I just it didn't really surprise me that these people were experiencing regret that they were killing, you know, people even though those people themselves  may have deserved it.   That that  revelation really didn't blow me away that they were feeling that way and   and I I  have a personal rule that if , you know, you don't really know the names of characters you can't really get that involved with them, and in all honesty the only two people whose names I remember from this movie are Avner who was  Eric Bana's character and Carl who was played    by  Ciaran Hinds  in this movie and  I really didn't  I I  like I I  really didn't have any kind of emotional attachment to any of the characters in this movie.   I I  was really unaffected by it.  Geoffrey Rush is in it and  he was alright and  Daniel Craig who was James Bond is also in the movie but  there there  were some genuine moments of like tension and excitement and   but in all honesty it really didn't add up to much for me. It it  just, the movie just went on and on. It was about two hours and forty minutes long and it just   I just became less and less invested in it as time progressed and  it was, it was  just an okay movie. So I I  really, I I  don't really recommend it. There are better movies by Spielberg. Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, any of the Indiana Jones movies although that's like comparing apples and oranges. But  yeah, this was just . I I  really didn't, I I  didn't really like it that much so there you go.	5.745
Hi guys,  I'll be reviewing about the movie Iron Man.  This is  also one of the action, hero adventure kind of movies like Spider-Man or Batman kind of stuff and now there's an Iron Man.  So it originated from a comic series as you know Iron Man is a very famous comic series and other bunch of  video games for him.  Iron Man also, so this movie  it, it's  start with the    a family  known for known for  the genius Stark family and it's every descendant of the family have some some  had done some great work like  like this but in this part, in this particular  movie the guy's who's the main leading character.   He's, he's  the, like the owner of a company the Stark company which deals in the manufacturing of other ammunition stuff for the army.  The Tony Stark this guy is being played by Robert Downey Junior and he, he  has xxx some really good job. Paints I didn't see any flaw in this movie and since I, I,   there was no point of time I was looking at my watch.  So that then,  so that then that is the story, when is this movie going to finish because you just take to this movie just watch this movie and he's, I enjoyed this movie.  So the plot of the movie is that this  Tony Stark is a genius with, he he  single-handedly like whatever he want, he's so knowledgeable and sophisticated.  So one day he was  on the demonstration in the field in Iraq and all of a sudden some people kidnapped him and grabbed him. They want him to make the ammunition for them.  The xxx missiles but he kind of fight them and make  make himself some kind of core thing known as Iron Man,  but escape from there and from there as he got a big idea to make some kind of shield around him so that he can go anywhere he wants.  He can fight with anyone he wants, he has all these great powers. So he may really that stuff  where's the R and D facility he has, it was quite an awesome   power guy xxx developing such a complicated machine even a bunch of scientists working in the lab can't do that.  So it was a fun movie and  and then as in usual in the end  good guy always wins. So he defeated the guy who was  bad in his company who really want to give ammunition to the terrorists also. So this is quite a good movie and would, I would definitely recommend you to watch this movie and  now I'm being a fan of Iron Man I'm waiting for it, they're gonna make  Iron Man Two.  And I'm gonna, I'm gonna  give this a five out of five.  Again a review for the movie Iron Man.	3.162
Hi Expo TV, my name is Nastassia and I would like to tell you about the movie IronMan. IronMan is yet another awesome comic book movie. It stars Robert Downey Junior and he plays this rich playboy named Tony Stark who isn't just a dumb rich kid, he is also an engineering genius and he runs this weapon company, Stark Industries and he's demonstrating a new missile in Afghanistan when he's captured and he's pretty severely wounded. And the people who captured him, you know they are not just planning to hold him for ransom like you would expect. They want him to make them a missile. Instead, he builds this awesome armored suit that makes him into iron man. And it lets him escape and it also protects him because he still has shrapnel in his chest and that can kinda kill you. So this suit protects him, helps him get away, and gives him these awesome powers. Now the movie is really good because it's not just focused on the action scenes and the fighting and the stuff like that. It gives you a really good backstory explaining the origin of the suit, the origin of his powers, and it's definitely a movie that would lend itself to a couple sequels based on that. It actually kinda reminds me of Batman Begins because even though it has all the cool action scenes and it's really good, it's almost more about letting you get to know the characters and how they became what they will be in the future. Now Robert Downey Jr. did an amazing job in this movie. He's such a good actor and he, I think this is one of his best roles. And Gwyneth Paltrow is actually in this too, I didn't know that before I went to the movie, I guess I wasn't paying that close attention to the commercials but, she plays his secretary, Pepper Potts, which will never stop making me laugh when I hear that name. So if you like comic book movies, if you look super hero movies you should go see this. And even if it's not usually your type of thing, go see it anyway. It's a really good movie, it's got a good script, the acting is great and I just can't recommend it enough. Go see Iron Man, it rocks. I am totally buying it as soon as it comes out in DVD.	7.0
What's up, ExpoTV? I saw a movie called Don't You Don't Mess With the Zohan.  It's starring, I guess, Adam Sandler. And  you really don't want to even mess with this movie, to be completely honest. It was absolutely terrible, probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen in theaters.  It's it's it's  about how how  this guy, he's, like, this, like, secret agent, but he fakes his own death, and he moves to New York City and  he wants to be, like, a hair stylist, but then he also still has, like, his, like, spy skills, where he can, like, beat people up, like like  crazy, in crazy ways and stuff.  It's supposed to be, like, one of those, like, I guess outrageously funny movies, and it really, like, wasn't. The the  preview pretty much shows you what the whole movie is.  Like that trailer  he kicks people really weird that's, like, not realistic, like, he's supposed to be, like, this super super  agent, super hair stylist. And it's just like, kind of like making fun of, like , everyone, but it's, like, really stupid.  I I  thought that, like, Adam Sandler was starting to make better movies, but, like, he's definitely gotten worse and worse.  So I really would not bother with with  You Don't Mess With the Zohan at all, like, not even on DVD, absolutely nothing.   I don't know where he got the idea for this,  but it really is absolutely terrible.  It has, like, the same cast as all his other movies, like, Rob Schneider, people like that. But, like but like  the story and the whole plot, it was just absolutely terrible. So  I would have to give You Don't Mess With the Zohan  one out of five. Do not see this movie. Please don't see it. You Don't Mess With Zohan, one out of five.	5.066
Hi.  Today I am reviewing the movie Incredible Hulk which is currently playing in theaters nationwide.  Now Incredible Hulk is a sequel to the movie, The Hulk and  let me tell you I wasn't a big fan of The Hulk but I saw all these trailers of Incredible Hulk and it looked so much action packed that I decided to go watch this movie.  I think that would be the biggest mistake that I've done this year of actually going to watch watch  this movie and  let me tell you this again that you know all these movies that are coming out in summer  you know which are really anticipated and what not. I am sure Incredible Hulk is the worst of all of those which have already released and which are going to release again so it's really bad and let me tell you why. So Hulk ended somewhere that you know so he he's   kinda running away from the army and what not so this movie starts that this guy now wants to cure himself and  he's not in North America anymore. He's somewhere in Central America hiding away from the army because they still want him.  And   out of whatever less than two hours movie, only ten minutes is when you know the hulk is actually on the screen, the rest, it's this guy planning how to, kind of you know, get away, cure himself  from being the hulk because that's basically his heart rate goes up and he turns into the hulk.  Another thing that the trailers showed was was  another guy,  you know the size of hulk and looked really evil and I waited  pretty much the entire movie for this guy to show up and he just showed up for the last ten, fifteen minutes and   I I  pretty much slept in the movie you know. I was sleeping forty minutes into the movie, was that boring.  Because I thought of it as action packed,  it was not.  Another thing I noticed  was the animation part, it seems that they have just focused on the bodies of these two you know the Hulk and the evil guy. The rest and you know, the blast and the helicopter crashes and what not. The animations was really poor. Like you can tell its, its  computer animated and it's really bad. Like I would expect this kind of animations back in the nineteen-nineties but it is two-thousand eight  and no one expect that kind of animations. It was really disappointing.  The the  direction was okay and the acting was okay but the story line was    The story just didn't move at all. It, it  was just there and it was like you know they could have ended the movie in ten minutes if they wanted to.  That that's , you know is the gist of the story, that's the gist of the movie and  I rate this, this movie a one on five and  recommend do not go until you are huge huge fan of  The Hulk  do not go to theaters to watch this movie, it's, it's  going to disappoint you, it's going to take away those two hours of your life that you are never going to get, and plus you would end up spending money which won't be worth you know the the   the the  money that's out of you  so overall,  very disappointed by this movie,  The Incredible Hulk playing in  in theaters nation wide  decide yourself if wanna go now,  I won't recommend it so don't.	6.055
There are two types of people in this world people who like M. Night Shyamalan films and people who do not like M. Night Shyamalan films. I am one who does. This is a completely unbiased review against M. Night Shyamalan. I actually loved his first three films. I mean, I loved his first three films. The Village and Lady in the Water were complete letdowns for me. And I said to myself, if this one, The Happening, is not as good as his first three, I am going to say I'm not going to go see his movies anymore. And I think that's the way it's going to be. The movie was absolutely terrible. It wasn't, like, the worst movie ever made, like some people are saying, but it was pretty awful.  The idea, as far-fetched as it is in the movie, is probably the best part of the movie. The idea he came up with for the movie, that was probably the best part. But everything about the movie, the dialog, the acting, the casting , the pace, the tone, the plot, where it goes, the scary moments, the gore, all that that I just named is awful. It is just awful. It is just awful.  Now, I have to make this review kind of short. And I wish I could I could  talk longer. I could probably go on for, like, ten minutes about it, but I can't.   I'm going to tell you really fast why that's all bad and, like I said, the best part about the movie was just the idea.  Even the, even  how long it was. It was only an hour and a half. And I know a lot of movies are an hour and a half, but this one was really cut down. It could have, it could have  gone on for two hours. And I think that's what it should have been, but it wasn't. I mean, it was, that was a complete disappointment. You also don't care about the characters in the movie, if they die or not. You don't. I mean, I could go on forever, but sorry.  The,  Mark Wahlberg is in this movie. Okay? And you think he's going to be, like, this awesome actor, but, you know, this is his worst performance of his career. And I'm sorry, Santa. And he holds the movie up. And that's very sad. It's the worst performance of his career, but yet he holds the movie up. He's probably the best one, best best  actor in the movie. That's sad.  Zooey  Deschanel, just stop. Just stop. I don't even know what to say about you. Just take a year off and get your head together, because that, that  movie, it was just absolutely terrible. Your dialog, delivery, and everything about what you did, everything, everything about what you did was absolutely terrible.  The storyline and the way it was written, like I said, the idea was good, but M. Night Shyamalan, take a break. Seriously. Come out with a movie every three years, maybe every four years even.  Just take more time on your movies. You seriously, this could have been, had so much more potential and it went nowhere and you didn't care. You really didn't. It was, it was  laughable. It really was. And the, the dialog was probably one of the, if not the worst part of the movie, besides the acting, which was really bad. Dialog, delivery, and just the dialog had a, how you wrote it, it was absolutely awful. It wasn't realistic at all.  It was so bad, it was absolutely terrible.  What else?  {Sigh} I, I'm  sorry. I really can't say anything good about the movie. Even, even,  another thing I just wanted to end with. You think it's going to be a scary movie, but it's not. There's only one scene where you're holding onto your seat and you're about to, you know, like, those scenes where you're waiting to jump? There's only one of them. There's only one scene. It doesn't even last that long.  And you think, well, it's R-rated, so there's going to be a lot of gore, right? There's no gore. There's absolutely no gore. Every time you think you're about to see gore, it just cuts to a new scene. You don't see anything. I've seen more gore in the trailer of this movie. Okay? It's pathetic.  I really, you know, like I said, I really wish I could go on forever about this movie, but, in a nutshell, I do not recommend this movie. All those reasons, plus a million more  that makes this movie so bad. And the casting. I'm not saying Mark Wahlberg is not a good actor, because he is, but, first of all, not in this movie. And then, he doesn't play this character at all. He should not play this character at all. Okay? Because he's a science teacher. Okay? You do not, Mark Wahlberg, he's not a science teacher. And it doesn't matter that it's a movie, we're not going to believe that. So I do not recommend seeing this movie. And I am an M. Night Shyamalan fan, well, at least I was. Not after this movie. I doubt I'm going to see any more of his movies. The only reason I'd recommend seeing this movie is probably to laugh. And that's, that's  completely honest. And I will, I really wish I couldn't say that, because I do love the guy. Like I said, I did. But I can't. I can't. I really cannot recommend this movie. I can't say anything good about it. So do not go see this movie. It is laughable. You are seriously wasting your money. Okay. You seriously are. It is, is that bad. And you think I'm exaggerating, but once you see it, I seriously am not, you're going to understand exactly what I'm talking about.	7.0
Hi, this is Jeff here with another DVD review for you. Today  we're reviewing National Lampoon's Vacation starring  Chevy Chase. National Lampoon's Vacation is the classic road trip movie, starring the hilariously funny Chevy Chase  who, of course, starred in many of the National Lampoon's Vacation movies.  If anybody has ever gone on vacation with the family, this is a movie you can relate to.  The story is Clark Griswold, playing by Chevy Chase, takes his family on a road trip vacation across the United States, heading for the fictional WallyWorld.  And, of course, if anybody has traveled with their family locked into a car for multiple days, or even multiple hours, you know that things happen, funny things, not-so-funny things, and we get to see Chevy Chase's take on many of those.  And, of course, there is the story of the road trip and there is the story of the destination and what happens when they get to WallyWorld. I won't tell you what happens when they get to WallyWorld, because that is one of the greatest punchlines of the entire movie, and if you've not seen this classic, you certainly deserve to enjoy the surprise for yourself for the first time.  This movie is rated R. Now, when this movie was made  in nineteen eighty two, and it was rated in nineteen eighty three,  of course ratings have changed over the years. If it were made today, it probably would get a PG-thirteen, maybe even a PG.  It may not be a movie for your five-year-old, but screen it. It might be a movie that some of your  older kids can watch. But as it does have  an R rating,  it's something that you should screen yourself first if you've not seen it.  If you're a fan of the National Lampoon movies and you've seen some of the newer ones,  like Van Wilder, this is what started the franchise. Go back and watch the classics. If you enjoy the new ones,  the older ones are, are  just as good and  I and many would venture to say even better.  There is a theatrical trailer included on this DVD and  subtitles in English, French and  Spanish. The movie is only ninety-nine minutes long. It's it's  not the longest movie in the world, so you can sit down and enjoy it.  While they take it to extremes, I guarantee everybody will find some parallel to some part of their life growing up with their family.  National Lampoon's Vacation, starring Chevy Chase. A highly recommended movie. I suggest you go out and check it out today if you've not seen it before. And if you're a fan of the movie, pick it up. It's a DVD well worth having in your collection. Thanks, and see you next time.	5.0
I just recently returned from the  movie theater. I saw a movie that you may have heard of called Iron Man.  Iron Man is probably the biggest movie of the year so far, it's made more money than any other movie.  It's  I think Indiana Jones is  just  you know, is close to it but not quite  there, Iron Man is Iron Man is  still in the lead. It stars of course Robert Downey Junior, Terrence Howard,  Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeff Bridges. Jeff Bridges actually does a real good job in this movie, cause most of the time if if if  one of the Bridges brothers is in a movie  you know it's gonna be a B movie, but he actually does a pretty good job.   Iron Man the  this movie it's based on a comic book, a series of course. And the premise of it is that Robert Downey Junior he plays a character named Tony Stark who his  started with his father and now he's running the business,  they produce weapons. And he's, he's  idealistic and he's thinking well, you know, these weapons are going to defend the United States , you know, from terrorists and everything but he soon realizes   from events that happen in the movie that the terrorists are getting their hands on the weapons that he's making. So, you know, he's he's  caught with a dilemma and a decision  regarding his, you know, personal life, what he believes in and everything as far , you know, making the weapons. So  and like I said it's got much much more to this movie.  It's got a lot of special effects, I mean really good special effects, you know, you just won't believe some of the stuff that you see. And  Robert Downey Junior he is actually  a much, much better actor than people give him credit for and he does a wonderful job in this one and he , you know, he delivers  humor when it's needed to be delivered, I mean everything just works. The chemistry with everybody works  just fine. And  I don't think you can go wrong, so get to the theaters while it's still playing, watch it on the big screen, and then when it comes out  buy it on DVD cause  you know, like I said, it's just a really good movie and it's the best movie of the year so far. So go and check it out.	6.055
Hey, ExpoTV. This is Aubs eighty four and today I'm going to talk to you about the movie The Wedding Director.  This is a foreign film.  It's set in France and it's definitely subtitled. So if you're not a fan of sub-titles, you're gonna want to steer clear of this one.  If you don't mind subtitles and you're into foreign films, I would still say don't get your hopes up. It's just, it really isn't that good. Honestly, I was bored out of my mind and couldn't wait for this film to be over. It was long. It it  drew on and on.  In typical foreign film fashion, it was all about character development, and all about the background story and getting to know people. And, you know, generally I don't mind that. But when it's, in terms of this movie it was just so pointless and didn't seem to go anywhere and was just kind of a big circle of ridiculousness actually.   The basic plot of the story is that this guy, Franco, is a film maker and he's worried about  getting his daughter married to this extremist religious guy who's kind of crazy. So he's all whipped up about that and all of a sudden this scandal breaks loose and Franco's forced to flee his country. He has to leave  because he's kind of been indicted for some things. He's not looking very good. He's not gonna be making any more movies anytime soon in his homeland.  So he leaves and in his new city, he ends up being there and he meets this guy who finds out he's a film director and says, well can you film my daughter's wedding And Franco says, sure, I'll do that. And basically what happens is he's filming the wedding and he falls in love with this woman who's getting married. So it's kind of,  it's all out there. It's a little bit ridiculous with the extremist religious thing at the beginning and then the scandal and then falling in love with the girl. And it kind of doesn't really fit together.  I think any one of those three things could have been it's own separate movie and it would've been a better production, rather than trying to ravel all three of these things into one long, drawn-out and ridiculous film.  I think it would be enough to swallow  the whole scandal thing. And I can't, I can't  even go into all the detail around the scandal thing because it's so in-depth. And so  convoluted and messy. You just kind of have to watch the movie and read the subtitles for yourself  in order to figure it all out. And even for myself, I still wonder if I got the whole thing right. It's that messy.  And that was my least favorite part about the movie was that scandal and the huge shebang that happened because of it. It, it  could have been simplified or done as it's own movie where you can spend the time getting into and really explaining and delving into the whole situation.  When you try to combine it into a whole other movie like it was done in this one, it's just to much to digest. It would have took me  another two or three viewings  just to to  figure this out. And I don't think any movie should be that complex or that complicated, foreign or not. I mean  entertainment value here is what I want and that's not what I was given in this film at all.  I'm only gonna give it a one out of five rating.  I can't think of anything  for the movie as a whole that would have increased that rating.  If they would've broken it up I mean, then it's just different films so you can't even, it's comparing apples to oranges kind of.  But that would've been a better alternative to what they did here.   I I've  seen some foreign film lately that I really enjoyed. I really got into the story line and really felt part of these characters. But this one was kind of fantastical and weird and out there and just not worth my time. Again, one out of five stars. Don't waste your time seeing it in a theater. Don't even waste your time renting this one. It's just  not worth it. There are much better foreign films out there.	6.055
Hello, playing over my shoulder is this movie. This movie is called The Signal. I didn't like this movie and I'll tell you why. It's because three people, three different people, wrote it and directed it  all separately.  It utilizes pretty much the same cast from beginning to end and it's about    some sort of a strange signal that is  broadcast from an  unspecified source  over television waves and  radio waves and cellular phones, and regular phone lines. And  it just drives people insane, it  makes them want to just you know, wig out and start killing each other. And the first third of the movie I really enjoyed, I thought it was a really solid setup  for a pretty good horror movie. It felt like something along the lines of twenty-eight days later. And it just, it felt really solid and like it was going to be a good movie. And in the middle of the movie   tried really, really hard  to be funny and failed spectacularly.  It was it was  not funny at all, I like maybe laughed, I'd say maybe five times, one time pretty hard at something that happened,    but  over the course of forty minutes laughing five times at a part that is  supposed to be funny from start to finish,  that just doesn't, didn't cut it for me.  So  and there was one character in particular that was just  incredibly annoying  in the middle of it. His name was  Jim Parsons and I absolutely hated him.  There is no way that any normal human being would invite him to a party.   I'm going to hold this up here to block something out. {laugh}  Yeah I really didn't like this movie at, at, at  all. The first third of it was, was  pretty good. The middle of it totally ruined everything that came before and after it. And   the final third was mixed, it was okay.  Special features  include  deleted scenes, a making of  featurette,  and  yeah plenty of making of featurettes and  director's commentaries, so     I I I  don't recommend the special features,  I I  can't because I didn't watch them because I didn't like this movie  enough to watch them, so  I don't recommend this movie. Sorry.	5.354
This is The Bourne Supremacy. It's the second part of the three part series, which is  one of my favorite action movies with a lot of suspense and drama.  This is actually my least favorite of the three part series.  A lot of action and everything was really good in it.  As  as part of the series, I didn't think it held up to the rest of the series. The first entry and the last entry were really well written and a lot of action and a lot of suspense. This one is kind of   just moving you along and progressing it and it's not as fast paced as the other ones. Which being that it's an action movie, I felt like it was kind of a little sub par. Slowed down a little too much.  It's still a fantastic movie compared to other action movies but probably my least favorite out of the three part series.	3.109
Hey expotv, today I'm gonna review the movie that's currently in theaters  and that movie would be Hellboy Two.  Hellboy Two,  I wasn't all that excited to go see this but you know, people are going to see it so I was like, whatever I'll go and  it definitely didn't live up to even my low expectations. I thought it was worse than what I thought it would be.  By the way the subtitle to this movie is Hellboy Two and the Golden Army. Pretty much it's more just rampaging through  Hellboy beating people down and saying clever little phrases.   I don't know, something about the whole Hellboy theme I don't really like, personally. You know, it's another one of these blockbusters from a comic book.   So you know if you're a, if you're  a Hellboy fan you'll probably like it actually, but if you're just a general viewer I highly doubt you'll enjoy it, just because you don't really have any connection to it and it's just not good. If you don't have a connection it probably won't be good cause it's it's  just annoying.  Really all I can say is I was bored with this movie about halfway through and then just started getting annoyed with all the   kind of the, like the little lines and I mean it does have pretty good graphics and like explosions and stuff, but even those can't make up for its lack of anything else, so I give it one out of five stars for Hellboy and the Golden army.	4.655
This is Blood: The Last Vampire. It's a anime.  It's considered like a masterpiece. A lot of people highly recommend this. I watched it, I didn't think it was that great.  They even made a series after it, based off of the movie. The story, by the time it got started, it was already over.  It didn't actually start taking root til the very end of the like the last thirty minutes of the movie and by that time it was already over.  The animation, the graphics of it, it was it looked really good in some parts, and it some parts it looked horrible. But a lot of people praised it for its graphics at the time. I, I  didn't see it so much.  I'd say it was the average anime. I really wouldn't say that I would see it again if I had a choice.	3.367
Hey, ExpoTV. Aubs eighty four here today to talk to you about the movie the Ripple Effect, which is currently in theaters.  This movie is kind of low budget and doesn't feature a lot of well-known actors or actresses.  Forest Whitaker and Minnie Driver are the two that I recognized and that I have seen in other films.   The basic storyline of this movie is that there is a Hollywood  director and his life has kind of fallen apart, his marriage, his finances, his relationships. Everything is kind of going downhill. And the idea is that these changes kind of ripple out and affect all aspects of his life and lead to new things. So just like if you throw a rock in a, in a  pool of water,  the ripples kind of go out and they alter and affect all the water around them.  In the same same   stance, when his personal life kind of falls apart, it ripples out and affects this guy's professional life as well.  Fortunately, though, this guy does not let that ruin him or bring him down. It actually leads to a sort of awakening or revival, and he sets out to change a few things and to make his life better and to try to take, take  things into his own hands and do what he can to right all the situations.  Now, I don't know if this movie is  very well done, quite honestly.  It kind of seems like Minnie Driver and Forest Whitaker have had much better performances. And the main actor in this one also, even though I've never seen him before, I have to believe that he's had better performances like this. He doesn't seem to embody the character very well. I just don't picture this guy as as , I don't  picture the actor actually being this guy, going through this really hard time and, and  struggling through his life, as he deals with his marriage and everything else.  He doesn't sell it very well, in other words.  A poor job in that respect. And I think that, like the movie says, ripples out and affects the rest of the cast as well.  As I mentioned, the supporting actors and actresses kind of don't live up to the billing, they don't live up to  what they could have done and what they have done in some of their other roles. So I was let down, quite honestly.  I had heard little about the film before I saw it, but what I had heard was positive and, and,  your know, uplifting and thinking that it was going to be a good movie.  But, like I said, everything put together here wasn't. The soundtrack was downer. It was kind of depressing in parts and it just didn't rebound to give the highs to the positive notes of the movie like it should have. So even though it, the music dragged you down with a sad part of the movie, it did not bring you back up when it turned around and got happy. And I don't want to ruin anything, give away any plot spoilers or anything like that,  but things, you know, get better. When, when  he has an awakening, you can kind of expect that things are going to look up from there.  One thing to make the movie better, I think, I think  when it goes into the actual writing and directing, I don't think the writer or director brought out what they could have in these actors and actresses. Now, the writer just writes it and kind of leaves it at that, but a lot of them tweak it  based on what the  actors' and actresses' input is. So, for instance, if they think this scene might work a little bit better this way, or if the director suggest that  this scene might be better dialogued this way, you know, the writer writes that in and makes changes. But I just don't see that being done. Maybe he was just given bad advice and made changes for the worse, or maybe, like I think, the actors, actresses, and director just weren't in this one wholeheartedly. I'm only going to give it a one out of five stars. Not a whole lot of redeeming quality about this movie.  Save your money. Don't go see it in the theaters and don't rent it.	4.69
ExpoTV, this is Aubs eighty four and I'm going to talk to you today about the movie The Doorman, which is currently in theaters.  This is a very low-quality film, very low budget, nobody  of any kind of  ability actually in acting is in this film  no well-known actors, no well-known actresses, nobody directing or even writing it that you probably would have ever heard of. It follows the story of a doorman in New York City, or basically a bouncer at one of the clubs. And he's very popular, very well known.  He kind of goes on a big power trip about how he can get people into this club and how he knows all these people and blah, blah, blah. And it's all about him and his life and he's so cool.  But eventually, he loses his job and he comes crashing down to earth  when he loses his job because he realizes he pretty much has nothing to go on.  The people he knew and were so friendly with, I mean, they don't talk to him anymore since the, he can't get them into any clubs. They were basically using him for  his position at the door. And they weren't really friends at all. And he kind of tries to come to terms with this, has to get a grip on things and realize what's actually going on in his life and what he has going for him.  Now, that that  may sound like it has some potential and it may be going somewhere and it could be, you know, some big story about self-revelation or interesting of the fact that he knows all these people and it could be synopses of people's lives that come to the club and the information he can get from them, and, you know, just kind of cool, it could be kind of like a back,  behind-the-scenes type of cool thing about these popular people.   However, it's nothing like that. It's actually quite terrible. It is basically a big ego trip by this doorman guy  and how he wallows in self-pity and self-realization when it turns out that he actually has nothing. The writing  was pathetic,  quite frankly. The story goes nowhere. It's basically a big circle. He wakes up one day, feels sorry for himself, tries to get over it, can't, goes out, gets shunned by these people he's tied to, comes back, and crashes, gets drunk and is worthless. Gets up the next morning and it goes around in a circle again. Gets up the next morning and it goes, anyway, you get the idea. It keeps going round and round and round. Same thing over and over and over again. Not worth seeing, not worth renting, not worth wasting your life over, quite frankly. The soundtrack is nonexistent, for the most part. Not that it could have added much to a movie like this, but still, at least maybe some good music would have redeemed it in a small way. But not even that. So it's all downhill.  Nobody can really act in this one. It all keeps, seems very staged, very set up, nobody is acting natural, nobody is getting into their roles, and nobody is meshing with one another. It's almost as if they're all competing with each other to get a space and to try to get themselves known so they can go to Hollywood and make a real good film. I would say that this movie should have gone straight to DVD or straight to the garbage, quite frankly.  One out of five stars is what I have to give it because I can't give a zero out of five stars. Do not waste your time on this one. It's completely not worth it.	7.0
The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor. I'm gonna just come out right and say it. Do not go see this movie.  It fails on every level possible. They shouldn't have not even made the movie.  They probably even shouldn't have made the second one to be honest. And  there's, I can't really say one good thing about this movie.   The casting, Rachel Weisz, is not a return a big problem there. Big problem. It really has an effect on the movie. You don't love the characters as much cause the original actress that played Brendan Fraser's wife is not back. Brendan Fraser just fails entirely. He's not funny anymore, he's getting older, and the whole hero guy who tries to be funny with the one-liners, just just  stop. Just, it's terrible. The plot  it has nothing to do with the first or second Mummy anymore, which is you know, it's a good idea you know? Maybe get away from that. But you don't care, you really don't care about the tomb of the Dragon Emperor, this Dragon Emperor guy, you don't care.  The special effects are way too over the top and not only are they over the top, but they are fake. You can it's it's  insulting. It is insulting the way they are.  And I'm not trying to be like, mean about it like you need to do better but they do need to do better. I mean the public is so used to special effects and computer effects now that we expect a lot more and we are being insulted by this movie. Everything about it, the special effects you can tell are fake and they're just trying to put so much action on you and and  CGI and special effects that like  the movie and the plot just are completely lost and they're just trying to throw that to make up for it. So really  and it doesn't make up for it at all. So I do not recommend seeing this movie. It was  in a way it was entertaining, in a way. But really it's not worth your money. I I  think if you took your kids to go see it I think I think teenage audiences or them might enjoy it but really, it's that great a movie. I think it's  I think it's gonna fail   on all levels. Really I don't think it's good at all.  Really, I mean just, you gotta go see it. You gotta know what I'm talking about. It's just old. The Mummy franchise is dead, or they need to reboot it or something because Brendan Fraser's one-liners in all this stuff, it's just the public's not gonna take it anymore. It's really boring, it's old, it's cheesy. It it  was old five years ago, seriously so just stop it.   I guess the good thing about the movie was it was it was  so  it was it was  so like bad that it was entertaining cause like, you kinda lose yourself in it in the fact that it's not real. I mean obviously it's not gonna be real, you know, a mummy coming to life but like  it's just so over the top that it's like somewhat entertaining you know what I mean. Like it's just so unbelievable that you just gotta sit back and kind of enjoy the ride while you go along with it. So that's that's  one good thing I'd say about it. Other than that though I do not recommend this movie at all. Do not go see it really. Do not waste your money on it.  Or if you're going to, go see matinee or something cheaper, seriously. I just, I think you're gonna get bored with it. It's just too much CGI, too much action and it's it's  over the top, it really is. So  don't go see it in my opinion. It's not good. I'm gonna give it two out of, two out of  five stars.	4.435
Hey, hey. My name is Mike and today I'll be talking to you about the movie Swing Vote. As formality, here is my movie ticket.  And there we go. So the basic premise of this movie is as follows: Kevin Costner plays a character who is just sort of the  lame sort of loser. He, you know, doesn't really give a care about anything. And  so his life is just sort of passing him by. His daughter tries to get him to vote, so he goes and votes, and it causes a screw-up that la-de-dah-de-dah. Big surprise. Causing it so that his vote is the one that decides the presidential election.  Okay. Well, that's a pretty unlikely-sounding premise, but let's run with it for a second. So then the rest of the movie falls upon the idea of, hey, look at him becoming blobbity-blobbity, look at him deciding the election, all the things that sort of happen. Everyone is trying to get his opinion. He can't really decide, for a while, doesn't care. He starts to care a little.  And , well, it's supposed to sort of have the message that everyone's vote matters and voting is important and look at the American political system. If anything, all it does is bore people of the American political system even more. This movie is dull, dull as dirt, duller than dirt. If there was something duller than dirt, that would be it.  It's, there's nothing really exciting. Kevin Costner put in an all-right performance, but that's not enough to save the fact that this movie just isn't very good. You know? The premise is sort of laughable. The implementation is meh, thumbs down. And so then you're just end with, you know, it's a political movie that's supposed to be like, oh, sort of satirical a little, but it's not very satirical.  So what you end up with is they took a movie that, they took two movies, really, one that's sort of the Disney culture movie of, hey, look, we're making a family-friendly movie. But that fails because it's boring and can't hold anyone's attention, a child or an adult. And then they sort of had a sort of, hey, let's make a satirical political movie. And that sort of fails because it's not well done. They didn't satirize  anything to a sufficient degree. You know, it just sort of felt, so then you try to put it together and neither one succeeds.  So, Swing Vote, Kevin Costner, one out of five. You know, the only reason I liked this movie in any way, shape, or form is because I like reviewing bad movies. So, Mike here, saying one out of five. Goodbye. And just for a change of pace, I'm going to turn all the way around.	5.745
I went to the movies to see Pineapple Express. It wasn't my choice of movie to see, but I was outvoted on that one.  It was okay.   I I'm  really not into movies about stoners and drugs and stuff like that. And that's what the Pineapple Express movie is.  It stars Seth Rogen, who has been in just about every  movie lately, it seems like. He was in the movie Stepbrothers.  He was in the movie, the voice of a, one of the characters in Kung Fu Panda. He was in Knocked Up and Superbad. And he's really making a name for himself lately. I just didn't really think this was the best movie to go see.  Pineapple Express  the movie got its name because that's supposedly the name of a new new  strain of marijuana.  And   and they talk about that during the movie. It's definitely not for kids. It's just for adults.  If you're not into what I would call a drug movie, you probably wouldn't like it. It was okay. It passed the time. It's not one that I would recommend to people to go see. They would probably find another movie that they would like better. You know, if if  you've seen everything else out in the theaters and you're wanting to go to the movies, you're looking for something to see, it will entertain you, it will pass the time, but it wouldn't be my first pick of a movie to  tell somebody to go see.	3.873
Hey all. It's the king of movies here and today I'm going to review  The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor. Now  this is a new movie  starring  Brendan Fraser, Jet Li, and Maria Bello and it's the third  movie in the, The Mummy series.  I believe the last one was actually in two-thousand-one or two-thousand-three. It was definitely over five years ago so  this is kind of a surprise in a way to see a sequel so soon, perhaps it's because  Indiana Jones four came out and people are kind of on that adventure wave right now. They're,   they're enjoying their adventure kind of movie.   This movie as as  the other ones were is is  not to be taken too seriously, it's pretty much popcorn entertainment.  It's just something that you watch, mindless fun  that you eventually, you know, just forget about pretty much immediately after watching it.   As as  popcorn entertainment it doesn't really   fail necessarily, but it doesn't do its job as great as say even the first Mummy.  The movie has Jet Li in it, which is a nice surprise, but I feel that if they  could have used him more in it  it would have been movie if they did.  There's some CGI in, CGI in  here that isn't very good and  usually there shouldn't be a problem but  it just detracts from the experience I think.   It ends up being a little   a little disappointing.  There's also just not that much  stuff in terms of originality. It's a lot like the other Mummies, if you've seen those and you like them you'll probably want to just see this cause you'll like it too. If you're looking for even like a slight twist in the Mummy formula you probably won't wanna bother watching this because you're not going to be getting something like that. So once again, if you, if you  enjoy just popcorn movies like even Journey to the Center of the Earth, if you like that  you might want to check this out.  Unfortunately this one isn't in three D though, so it's not as entertaining but   I think this is strictly for Mummy fans and people that just want  some kind of escapist movie to forget about their worries for ninety minutes. And that's my review of The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor.  In this movie they actually go to China and that's the whole dragon thing and that's why Jet Li is in it, in case you were wondering. And that's my review.	4.69
Hello Expo TV.  Today I'm reviewing the movie  Death Race.   This means two out of five.  It really wasn't very good.  It stars Jason Statham.  You might recognize him from the Crank movies, where he was like a getaway driver kind of,  drug runner.  Anyways,   where do I start?  The movie takes place in two thousand twelve. It's about a guy that goes to prison for a crime he didn't commit. It's a like, for profit prison where they have this pay-per-view creation that's these death races and  they have convicts racing in like cars with all kinds of crazy stuff like missiles and flamethrowers and machine guns and  they kill each other and if you win,  it's five races, you get your freedom. So, that's kind of the premise of the movie.   Honestly that sounds pretty stupid. I don't even know why I saw it.  But at least now you guys are warned. Don't see Death Race.  I wouldn't even rent it.  It's really pretty bad.  I mean, there's a lot of action. If you like senseless action, Death Race is your movie. But otherwise, Death Race, two out of five.	4.435
I am reviewing shop girl. Has Steve Martin, Claire Danes, and Jason Jason  Schwartzman and  the movie is rated R. And it is described as a cute romantic comedy on the back.  I would not recommend this movie at all {laughter}. It is based on a short novel or novella written by Steve Martin. And so I had these expectations that this movie would be along the lines of  Roxanne or   You've Got Mail, Sleepless in Seattle, Never Been Kissed, that kind of cute romantic comedy. It is, to me very dark.  It's actually a little odd. It's this girl  basically is kinda torn between these two guys. A young guy that's not going anywhere and a rich older entrepreneur who's Steve Martin. But he has issues and the young guy has issues and there's a lot of sex in it and it's, it's just not a movie at all that I would recommend. So if you see this at the rental place, do not rent it.	5.745
Hello, my name is Mike, and today I'll be talking to you about the movie Traitor, which I went and saw last night. As formality, here is my movie ticket.  And there it went.  So, Traitor is a movie about , it's a basic spy movie. The premise here is really not good in any way, shape, or form. But I will try to hack it together for you. So, this , sort of, straight-laced FBI dude is investigating , a bunch of crazy stuff that happened. And it turns out that this other sort of counter intelligence dude for the US,  is always seems to be connected to all of it. So, it's, he has to figure out what's going on and why this is happening and is person number two involved with this, and is he a good guy or a bad guy, is the people is coming to help him investigate and are they good or bad is there other interests in here.  That's the premise. It's a really bad spy movie cause it really feels like there's no real story to it. There's the investigation element, but that's it. You know, what's the story, what's the point. There is none. That's the flaw of this movie. The script was written as sort of a, sub-element. You know, it's missing the greater story to which the script plugs in to. And, that's why I can't give this movie anything more than a one out of five, cause it was atrocious.  And this isn't worth seeing at all, cause I mean, come on, you can come up with better spy movies than this. There are so many. And I mean, not necessarily like spy like, James Bond, but counter, like you know, investigation spy movies. There are so many better ones to be doing.  So, I have to say, one out of five. This was horrible. The premise is barely there at all.  It's like a quarter of a movie but running the full length. Which is bad because the actors do a good job, but that cannot save it from being an atrocious pile of junk. So, one out five for Traitor. Thank you and good night, and don't see it.	6.683
I'm reviewing Shopgirl the DVD.  It is a movie made off of Steve Martin's novella that he  wrote and it is about a girl that is torn between two lovers and she can't really decide between which one, the rich old man or the young man.  Neither of them are really going anywhere.  And I would not recommend this movie. It is a rated R movie and it has lots of sex. Not really that much in the language department but it was just  a very  blah movie and it was supposed to be a romantic comedy but I didn't see that it was funny in any way and it was not a movie that I would recommend for anybody to go  see. So  if you like Steve Martin even, it's not the Steve Martin that you would  think you're getting. It is maybe more of the Steve Martin that is in   that movie  I can't think of what it's called, not Grand Canyon but  anyway.   About people in LA but I've lost what I'm gonna say.  LA Story? Anyway  not recommended by me.	3.0
Hey Expo TV. Today I'm here to talk about the movie in theaters, Mirrors  featuring Kiefer Sutherland. After seeing this one  recently here, I pretty much got what I expected from it.  And what I expected was a poor cliche   horror film with bad acting, bad plot   trying to, you know just trying to scare you and failing miserably. That's exactly what this movie was.  The premise for this movie is  Kiefer Sutherland's character   takes up a job as a night watchmen in a burnt out department store.  And there's mirrors in this department store.  And  in the mirrors, naturally he sees horrific images.  You know, demonic images. He see's himself  like being tortured and stuff like that.  And I don't wanna ruin the pathetic plot of this movie   but obviously he has to confront what's behind these visions in the mirrors and discover why it's happening, how it's happening, how to stop it, why it's happening to him. Actually he needs to enlist some help from his friend Amy.   And it's just kind of your classic   bad horror film. It wasn't really scary, very very predictable   and poor acting. Kiefer Sutherland  does a very bad job in this film with his acting. He's not convincing. The fear he's supposed to be conveying to the audience doesn't seem real. It seems very forced.  It seems like he's expecting what he's seeing  which obviously as the actor he is, but as the character he supposed to be, he's not supposed to expect it so it doesn't really fit.  Combine that with bad language also in the film and this movie just goes downhill. So I'm gonna say one out five stars for The Mirrors.  Don't waste your time with this horror flick  much better ones out there. Thumbs down.	5.686
Hey expo Tv. Today I am going to talk about another summer movie that is currently in theaters. Vicky Cristina Barcelona.   xxx seen this with a few of my friends and I was much more soft having done so  this film has little substance. It's a Woody Allen film strangely enough which you would think that it would have some substance but not this one   with some big name actors Javier Bardem  Scarlett Johansson and Penelope Cruz all on this film. And basically what it is, I will give you the basic plot Penelope Cruz, her character and Scarlett Johansson's character   travel to Barcelona  and there you know they are alone and they are young females. Basically there they just have  relations with Javier Bardem's character   and he's still involved with with his wife so it's kinda like a love quadrangle not a triangle cause there's three of them and one guy so quadrangle  that's about as deep as the plot gets  they try to do some cheesy plot development and cheesy character development. It doesn't really work.  There's a little bit of humor in the film   I think Woody Allen has an interesting sense of humor, a very dry sense of humor. That I think worked with the film   but originality wise, this movie is nothing that hasn't been made before It's just kinda sleezy  waste of time completes your mind type of thing. Not a family film by any means not a children's film by any means   so I would not recommend Vicky Christina Barcelona at  at any case scenario don't waste your time don't waste your money don't pollute your mind not a good film one out of five stars thumbs down.	5.354
Hello expo TV, today I'll be reviewing the movie  The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon  Tomb of the Dragon Emperor. So this movie is basically a simple version of   so, in this part what they have done is they basically shift their focus from Egypt to  China near to the Great Wall of China. So, in this one with Brendan Fraser is shown as  an old guy and  he has a son, grown-up son, who is an archaeologist.  And and  he basically fell for Chinese girl  who wanted to protect the  basically I don't, I want to say this thing, but   So this movie is all about  the same thing, instead of the mummy from Egypt, they're now looking for a mummy in  China.  It's about an emperor, who was really powerful in  era a lot and {clears throat}  he is he is  almost conquered the world, but some somebody  basically stopped him and make him  give him  kind of trapped him in his body and. So this, the friend, Fraser's son was  searching for that tomb and basically found that that there was an army like   an evil army as always  who want to take advantage of that. So this thing all happened in  {clears throat} really fast manner, so I would say that movie was not as comparable as Mummy and Mummy's Return  because I didn't this one as much because it seems that you are watching the same movie, but  like all the action, per scene, there was not much of a difference that all people are rising from the grave, and so.   and {clears throat}  there are like lot of new character being introduced in the movie. You'd see that there are like big gorillas, snowmen, or so that was kind of a weird thing, so I'll say that this movie was just just  an okay movie and I'm going to give this movie like two out of five.  Again expo TV, I reviewed for the movie The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor.	3.109
Now I'm going to give you a review of Iron Man, the first big blockbuster hit of this summer.   A comic book adaptation from Marvel starring Robert Downey Junior in the title role, and Jeff Bridges as the villain.   Iron Man is fantastic. One of the best  comic book adaptations to come out to date, surpassed maybe only by The Dark Knight  later this summer, even more recently.   The core of the movie is Robert Downey Junior's performance. He is simply brilliant as Tony Stark.  The the  wit and creativity that he brings to the role really carried the movie throughout, but it's not the only plus.  Jeff Bridges gives a reliably good performance as the counterpart villain  to Tony Stark in the film's little corporate executive turned superhero supervillain battle.   And director Jon Favreau does an excellent job  shaping the action and putting together a story that really holds viewers attentions the whole way through. The movie never really sags, and has great supporting performances from Terrence Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow.  If you haven't managed to see it yet, you're probably going to have to wait for DVD which isn't too long, but it is absolutely a movie that you must see.	6.055
Hey all, it's the king of movies here, and today I'm going to review The Clone Wars. And this is a new movie  produced by George Lucas and it's part of the Star Wars series.  It's, it's  CGI animated and   this movie's  basically a different take on the the  Star Wars  story.  It branches off in a way. And  I thought this movie was actually pretty disappointing.  It's not too surprising though because the last three  the three new movies in the Star Wars episodes, episodes one through three were pretty  awful overall. And this  sticks to that  same beat as  the story is, is  pretty weak. The dialogue is just horrible and it didn't seem like this is a movie that you would expect to see in theaters. It seemed more like a movie you'd, you'd find on like TV, Cartoon Network or something like that, like a  ninety minute feature length  straight to TV movie.  I wouldn't suggest watching this movie unless you're a huge Star Wars fan, and even at that I would  I would only suggest watching it on TV or DVD or something like that. It's not worth watching in theaters really. Unless you're a big fan of  the other  Star Wars related  early movies. Then  I suggest you stay away.	4.082
I am reviewing Elf,  which is a cute cute Christmas  movie.  It is rated PG. It stars Will Ferrell and it actually has  lots of other people in it that are famous for other things. Ed Asner and Bob Newhart, Mary Steenburgen and  anyways. Basically the premise, as you can see over my shoulder , there's this baby and in an orphanage and Santa comes to visit the orphanage and the baby accidentally goes back with Santa to the North Pole and so he is raised as if he is an elf although he's a full grown man. So at the beginning, you see him with all these elves and he's just not quite fitting in. So he finally realizes or finds out that he is actually a human and not an elf so he goes to Manhattan to find his real dad and  his family and he realizes that  his dad and the rest of the world don't have quite the Christmas spirit that he thinks they should have. So  he with the help of a department store elf that he falls in love with, try to teach the world the true meaning of Christmas and help Santa in the end. So it's a very cute family Christmas movie.	6.403
Hi this Matt movie review for Momma Mia this movie is pretty much a movie all about Abba, their songs and starring Meryl Streep and and  I don't know, I don't know why I thought this movie would be interesting, I didn't realize I didn't see the preview to the movie I heard that it had the songs in there I thought well this will be interesting  and I don't like musicals so this was hard for me to watch and one big problem with it is  the actors are singing the songs and you know their voice aren't the best  Meryl Streep she does a pretty good job actually she doesn't act very good in this movie, her acting's like so so, and her singing was pretty good, couple of songs pretty good   so you you  might enjoy this if you like musicals  I know a lot of people did enjoy this and they really were excited about seeing this and actually wanna see this again for me I wouldn't want to see this again   I didn't really like the movie, and I thought they could've I thought Meryl Streep could been done could been done a lot better at this  Pierce Brosnan is actually in this movie too and he sings horribly when  he comes up the scenes that he sings, just just  close your ears  run away it's it's bad.  But, so I can't recommend this movie to anybody, but than I don't like musicals so you take that as you want  but that's Momma Mia,  have fun watching it.	4.082
Hi there. I just returned from the theater and I saw this really really bad movie called  Beer for My Horses  and like I said, did I mention that it was bad? Well it was bad. It has Tom Skerrit in it,  that's not a reflection on him cause he's actually a good actor, it's got Toby Keith, who he's a country music singer and if you're listening to country music that's fine but he really shouldn't be acting, and it's also got  Ted Nugent. He's a former   rock singer or whatever but he's not really an actor either. So I mean you're you're  putting these people together to make this really bad movie and I guess that's what you're gonna get. It's rated PG-thirteen. The premise of it is there's these two deputies that are trying to do something. The sheriff doesn't really want them to do it but they do it anyway. So they take this road trip and  that's kind of how the movie goes. and like I said, you watch it for yourself and see what you think. I mean I wouldn't recommend you watch it, cause it was bad enough that I watched it one time.  I wouldn't see it at the theater and I wouldn't rent it either. I'd just try to forget about it.  Kinda like it was a bad dream, you know. Just forget it had ever happened. But  that's my opinion anyway. Like I said, Beer For My Horses is the title and  it's one that you should just  omit from your mind.	5.0
I'm reviewing Elf the Christmas movie that has become a classic now, it is with Will Ferrell as Buddy the elf,  Bob Newhart who is poppa elf Buddy's father Ed Asner is actually in it he is Santa,   Buddy finds out that he really is not an elf that he was   taken by Santa by accident back to the North Pole and raised as an elf but he is a large person so he finds out who his real parents are which are James Con and his mother is actually deceased, finds out James Con lives in New York so he wants to go visit his father, and so he goes there and becomes apart of the real world instead of the elf North Pole world and goes through many funny thing's in corporate America  he likes to eat all the sweets the food groups are sweets and  he finds out he has  brother, little brother to he doesn't like him to begin with but then he he   he starts to love him and, how he helps Santa in the end and he also falls in love with  elf,  woman elf that is  playing an elf at the department store that Santa is going to be at. Anyway it's very funny,  very family oriented.	2.708
All right, ExpoTV, I'm going to review Death Race. This is a outrageous movie that came out  in the middle of the August. It's been out for about a little over a month now.  It's about a prisoner who gets framed and he goes to he goes to  a prison. It's in the future kind of too. And the economy is bad and people don't have good jobs. You find that out in the beginning of the movie. And people don't have good jobs and stuff, so this guy gets framed and goes to jail. And he's, like, a really good race car driver, apparently. But that's not his job, it's just in his history. So he goes to jail and then  this   lady who runs the jail asks him to do this TV show that's viewed by, like, everyone in the USA. And so he, it's like a death race. That's why the, you just drive around these cars with guns all over them and try and win the race. And if you win all three races, then you're free and you don't have to serve your time anymore in jail. And it's really hard to win. And  she just wants, she just wants him to race in it because  he's really good at racing. But you'll find out more later in the movie.  But, anyway, so, yeah, it's Death Race.  The actor is John Statham. That's why I saw it, because he's in it. He's a really good actor. He's usually in action movies, like The Transporter and   a few other, like Crank, some other ones.  Also is Joan Allen. She's the lady who owns the prison and the TV show. And then a bunch of others, like Tyrese Gibson, people like that. He's another race car driver that  John Statham's character races against and tries to win. And so  this movie had a pretty good idea. Like, I liked the storyline.  But it was just too much, like, action and too much, like there wasn't, it didn't really even out. Like the acting and stuff, I don't know. The story was pretty good, though, but the overall overall  movie wasn't that great, probably like three out of five stars.   I'd recommend seeing it if you like any of the main characters in it. But, other than that, it's really nothing special. You're not going to be blown away by it or anything.  You can pretty much guess what's going to happen  halfway through the movie.  So it's rated R for strong violence and language.  So definitely want to be, like, at least seventeen to go see it. Definitely not a kids' movie.  It's about a hundred and five minutes long, so about hour and forty-five minutes. Pretty good size movie, average.  So, yeah, Death Race.  Wouldn't recommend seeing it unless you really like the characters and you like action, violence, language movies, stuff like that. So, yeah, Death Race.	3.559
Hi everybody today I'm reviewing the  VHS copy of Star Trek: Insurrection. Starring the  the next generation it has    all all  the characters which I can't remember the {Laughter} names. But  it's  really this is a negative review this is one that I am sad to say I really like star trek, I liked all the spinoffs, star trek, star trek the next generation. And a lot of the movies but Insurrection was a stinker.  It was horrible I can't recommend it.  This was given to me I would not have bought it.  It's it's  sad to say I mean you know I watched it out of curiosity just to see what was going on and and   it's just just  a really bad story, that's all there is to it. You know the effects are  these days there's just nothing that wows you. It's  nothing unusual but it is not always about effects it's about the storyline and the storyline is just boring. So  I can't recommend this and I certainly wouldn't buy it.  But have a good day anyway.	4.69
Hey expotv, Eric here. What we've got is the Radiohead documentary, Meeting People Is Easy. It's a film by Grant Gee about Radiohead.   It's ninety-five minutes long and basically it covers Radiohead's OK Computer world tour.  So this came out in nineteen-ninety-eight,  OK Computer came out in ninety-seven and this is probably the best documentary I've seen on Radiohead.   When I say documentary it's it's  kind a loose based documentary,  it shows a lot of concert footage,  some behind the scenes work like like  before they go out to perform, various interviews here and there. So there's not a lot of   direct contact between the, the videographer or whatever and  the guys from Radiohead. It's just clips  that were gathered around xxx this tour.  Nonetheless it's, it's  phenomenal. I, this is just an incredible documentary.   There are also a lot of new songs that you probably have never heard before   in this, and like there'll be some of the songs they just warm up with before they go out and play,  and if you can kinda tell from,  from the video quality it's just like it's real kind of airy, it's just kind of kind of  cold.  It just really sums up Radiohead and OK Computer really well, this documentary. And  Stanley Donwood does all the   artwork for it and this the  kind of disclaimer on it, says "this film contains  stroboscopic effects that adversely affect  epilepsy sufferers". So if you got epilepsy  be careful  to watch this movie, cause you know there's a lot of lights going on from the concerts and there's other things flashing in and out.  There's also clips from some of the music videos they've done. So overall Meeting People Is Easy is a fantastic documentary on Radiohead.	5.0
Hello. I wanna tell you about a movie I just saw in theaters. It's called Punisher: War Zone. This is of course a movie based upon the popular Marvel character The Punisher. Punisher AKA Frank Castle is played by Ray Stevenson and he's up against his classic nemesis, Jigsaw, played by Dominic West. This is actually  not that great of a movie. I was kind of disappointed. Most of the Marvel movies have been pretty good in recent years and most of the comic book movies in general have been fairly well done. This one's kind of weak, this is the third time they've made a Punisher movie and second one in recent years. It seems it's always getting a new cast and a new direction and it's just not working for me. The Punisher himself is kind of an avenging  angel, kind of in the grey area. Is he a good guy or bad guy? He goes out and punches those who have done wrong, basically by hunting them down and killing them. And  just like in the comic books  when he's good he's really good. When he's   bad it's unreadable. Well  when he's bad in the movies he's unwatchable. It's just a little too silly. It's a very very violent movie but the violence is  kind of poorly done. I mean, violence in and of itself is  okay, I reckon, if it's done correctly. But this kind of weak  I mean it's over the top violence. It's more ridiculous than it is  gritty and  I just didn't think they were able to pull this movie together. So I'll have to give it two stars, which is sad because I really like the character.	3.559
Hello. I want to talk to you about a movie I recently saw. It's called Twilight. Actually,  this is not your typical review. It's almost a warning. Do not let your girlfriend drag you to see Twilight. This movie is aimed at young girls. And  for some reason some of the older girls seem like to like it as well. But basically this is a movie for young, teenage girls and there's nothing there. There's not much of a plot. It's kind of run of the mill plot of a, a  young girl who gets sent away from her parents to back to, to her, her  father who, who lives in a different town. She goes to a new school and she's not fitting in. She sees a dreamy young boy and oh yeah, he happens to be a vampire. But he's not a bad vampire, he's a good vampire. He doesn't even drink people blood anymore.  except for some reason he's so infatuated with her he wants to drink her blood. And she's so infatuated with him that  she might just let him, and that's basically the tension for the whole movie.  will he? Won't he? Will she let him?  whatever. Drink blood, it's just kind of stupid. I guess it's supposed to be some sort of romantic tension there and all the young girls in the audience went crazy for it, and I guess they thought the guy was dreamy or hot, or whatever they think nowadays. But, to me,  I just wanted to go to sleep. It's not a good movie. There's nothing there. And  frankly, vampires aren't supposed to be this mushy romantic characters. And if you really want to go that route, go watch Dark Shadows reruns somewhere on TV, they have to be out there somewhere. They're a lot better. So,  see something else. See a real movie. See a real man movie, something with explosions or something. Don't go see this movie.	6.403
Hi, you're watching my video review of Role Models.  This is a comedy that's rated R. There's a lot of cursing and crudeness but unfortunately it's not a funny movie. The humor in the movie feels really forced, like they're trying too hard and the writing's not very good.  The movie is pretty formulaic, you know how the movies gonna end and I guess you could say that about a lot of movies in Hollywood but  at least try to be funny along the way but this movie doesn't really deliver that.  The character played by Sean William Scott is pretty annoying. Sean William Scott is  Stifler in every movie that he's in, and that might've been funny back when he made American Pie like ten years ago or however long it was but, when you play the same character in every movie it starts to wear thin and just wasn't that funny.  So, I would recommend looking somewhere else  and not watching Role Models. Thanks for watching my video review.	5.26
Hey expo. What's up?  Today I'm going to talk about a movie I saw called Valkyrie,  starring Tom Cruise.   Valkyrie was a bad movie.  First of all Valkyrie is about  a plot to assassinate Hitler before all hell breaks loose in Germany.  Now most of us are pretty familiar with the history of World War Two but we know that Hitler killed himself  so this is the first movie I ever went into knowing the ending. Now some people would say that that's important but it is when they're trying to create suspense around it.  Another thing that I didn't like about it was the fact that it starred Tom Cruise. Not just cause he's a nutjob, but because he really did not convince me. It wasn't  a German soldier trying to overthrow Hitler, it was Tom Cruise pretending to be an , pretending to be a German soldier overthrowing Hitler and we saw through that. He didn't even try, he didn't even attempt a German accent.  He can do an Irish accent in Far and Away, I don't understand why he couldn't do a German accent in this.  Also  I went into this movie expecting at least a little bit of action considering the fact that it, it's  surrounded by a war  and, you know, violence. However there was none whatsoever. There was maybe three gunshots in the entire thing and I think they all missed. Maybe one hit. And that was it, it was over. They caught him, the end. Sorry if I ruined it for you but you really shouldn't be seeing it anyway. So  don't waste your time, go see something better. Something funny that will make you laugh, like Yes Man.	3.367
Hi expo. Today I'd like to do a movie review for you of a movie that's currently in theaters so I have my ticket stub for here, and that's Bride Wars.  Bride Wars is a movie starring  Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway as Liv and Emma who are two girls who are best friends who get engaged at about the same time and  they're plan to do everything together, being each other's maids of honor, et cetera et cetera. And they both want to get married at the same place until they find out that only one of them can get married at the Plaza.   And a small war between them begins  because they both just  don't want to make any compromises. This movie  if you saw previews for it it looks kind of funny, but this movie actually wasn't very funny. It was very  average, very predictable, and the acting wasn't that great.  And you know I really do like to see fluffy chick flicks sometimes so I'm not against that but this one was pretty terrible. And I definitely recommend that if you're considering going to see Bride Wars that you save your money because it's not that good. So if you're looking for a movie to see with your girlfriends on a Friday night or a fluffy chick flick I would not recommend seeing Bride Wars because it's not what you expect, it's not worth the money, and it's not that good. So I don't give it a good review. Bride Wars. Don't go see it.	5.477
I went to the movies  with the people that I work with, and we saw the movie The Unborn.  I kind of wondered about this movie when I saw the previews. It was one of those ones that was gonna go one way or the other. It was either gonna be really good or it was gonna be really bad. Unfortunately, it was really bad. It was one of the worst movies ever.  The story line was completely stupid. It it  wasn't a good horror movie. It wasn't spooky. It wasn't scary. There was no part of the movie that made you jump. There were no you know, got you minutes or anything like that. I mean it was just  dumb.   I didn't like the movie. I wouldn't recommend it. If I saw it on TV I would change the channel.  I would, I would  tell everybody not to waste their money going to see it. If you're a die hard horror picture movie person, you probably still won't like it. But if you still want to see it, wait for it to come on DVD. Don't waste your money in the theater. The Unborn was a complete disappointment.	5.831
Hi, today I'm reviewing the movie Gran Torino, starring Clint Eastwood and directed by Clint Eastwood.  The movie is about a Korean war veteran, played by Eastwood, who lives in  a Detroit suburb suburb  and  is trying to cope with the changing of his neighborhood as several  Hmong  immigrants start to relocate into the town.  He is a very crotchety old man and he  starts the film at his wife's funeral with his disrespectful family who he's pretty much always disappointed with.  And he slowly comes to terms with the changing neighborhood around him and befriends the  Hmong neighbors next door.   Overall, this movie was not as great as I'd expected from  Eastwood. Both in the director's chair and as an actor.  I was kinda disappointed with it. I thought the dialogue was silly at times and it was  very melodramatic film.   Which was unfortunate cause I really wanted to go in to watch a great Eastwood film.  As an actor he plays jut kind of a crotchety old man, but he does turn into   the  kind of the Clint Eastwood we all  know and love. The  gun toting, don't take anything from anybody Clint Eastwood who  just kind of uses violence to get his way.  And he deals with the repercussions of that and  his own  personal feeling toward the immigrants in his town.  The character development was okay.   I really enjoyed seeing Clint Eastwood as this character. He was funny and very  gruff and  hard to love, which makes him likable. But overall, I really I was very disappointed with the film.  Eastwood was great in the movie.   But it was kind of a one dimensional character, even though he does kind of go through character transition that you would expect him to go through.  And it is kind of   typical kind of   an ending that you would see coming if you were paying attention to the movie and   kinda predictable. But I did like his performance. I would, overall I would have to give the movie only two out of five stars.  Like I said, I was disappointed with it overall. But  It's well worth it just to see Clint Eastwood turning into an old man and using a gun to get those darn kids off his lawn.  So if you are fan of Eastwood maybe check it out just to see him in what could be his last  acting role, or starring acting role anyway.  So just go ahead and check it out if you're an Eastwood fan, otherwise, stay away from it.	4.509
I'm gonna be reviewing the movie The Lucky Ones. This movie stars Tim Robbins and Rachel McAdams. Overall I would definitely recommend this movie cause I thought it had an excellent story and plot. This was a great drama. It featured a great cast and had great acting.  Overall, the movie is about three soldiers who return home from the Iraq war and they take a road trip together and you can see in the movie how they go home for the first time and they see how a lot of things have changed.  How it's affected their relationships and some of them are injured. So overall I would definitely recommend the movie The Lucky Ones.  I really enjoyed this movie. It was an excellent story. I liked the acting in it, it had a good cast and it was a good drama. This movie was better than I expected.	3.786
Hey everyone on ExpoTV dot com. Now today I'm going to be reviewing a movie in theaters called Fired Up.  Now I forget who this is starring but I'll give you a little summary of what the movie's about. It's about these two guys who are tired of summer football camps and decide to scheme and go to a cheerleading camp and obviously they're surrounded by all these young women and this guy, like they start falling for them and a bunch of stuff happens.  Now  overall  it wasn't really that funny. There was nothing really funny about it. They tried to use like sexual humor to get you to laugh but it didn't work.  It had a lot, here let's see, it's  actually I'm not even gonna see. But  it's just overall  another one of these stupid movies.  it's nothing special, nothing worth seeing. The plot is basically like I said, the summary sums it up, so if that sounds interesting go watch it, I don't know. But obviously, I mean honestly I think that it was a terrible movie. It just left me, I left the theaters just completely yawning and bored and I don't know why I just spent my money so please do not waste your money watching this movie. I rate this movie two out of five.	4.69
Hey guys, Tina here and I want to do a review for you today of a movie that I just watched on DVD and the movie is called The Haunting, it's The Haunting of Molly Hartley.  This is a rated R movie on DVD, it's just recently released on DVD and there aren't any well known  actors in this movie, a lot of no names. I honestly can't name one character for you that I knew in this movie. Some of the faces looked familiar but  not so much that I would be able to name them for you. It's basically   based on the haunting of a high school student  who's haunted by her mother.  Apparently her mother tries to  kill her when she's younger and   it really haunts her in terms of psychologically. She has to see doctors and so forth. I think it's more of a a  teen flick more than anything because it revolves a lot of the, the  things are based in the high school where  Molly goes to school at.  I watched it with my eleven year old daughter and she really enjoyed it, she likes scary movies, and it does have some scary points in it. I didn't really care for it, all I could say it's more of a a  teeny bop movie.  I would probably give it  I dunno, maybe a two out of five stars.	4.435
Hi everyone, today I'm doing my  review on this movie called The International.  Clive Owens is in it and to be honest with you I don't remember it very much. I watched it about a week ago in theaters and it was so boring. It's supposed to be kind of this like thriller drama, but half the time I didn't know what was going on.   He basically is a detective or works for the law and is looking for this person and these people that are in charge of a bank that  supposedly trying to kill people and murder people and get away with it.  That's the main plot line. But he his  character didn't seem very strong. The supporting characters didn't seem very strong. The story line was kind of boring. So I would not recommend this to anybody to go in theaters and watch. I probably wouldn't  recommend it renting it either when it comes out on DVD. Maybe if it's on TV.	4.655
Hey there expo. So regrettably yesterday I went to go see Next Day Air.   One of my poorer choices, to say the least.  But it was a rainy afternoon, didn't really anything to do so headed out for a matinee. Figured, you know, lower price, can't lose too bad, right?  Well I went to go see Next Day Air cause  I'd already seen Star Trek and I heard awful things about Wolverine. So   yeah. This was  supposed to be a comedy.  It wasn't that funny. I mean there was some funny parts,  I'll I'll  give it that. But overall it wasn't fun to watch,  the acting was  subpar to say the least.  It did have  Turk from Scrubs fame  and Avon Barksdale from The Wire so some actors that I was familiar with.  But they did not really deliver the package, so to speak,  in this, in this  film. Brief synopsis   a cocaine shipment from Mexico gets delivered to the wrong apartment in Philadelphia and chaos and hilarity ensue,  or at least they're supposed to.  Chaos definitely happened. Hilarious   not so much.  It had its funny moments but overall I would definitely not watch it again and if I had the choice I would go back and not see it.  So that's, yeah Next Day Air. It's in theaters now. If you're looking for a way to waste your afternoon, go ahead and see it.	5.354
Hey, how you doing? My name is Roger. Went and saw Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince   the other night. And I will tell you I am not  one of those Harry Potter fans. Have not read the books.  Have seen the other movies, but I've seen the movies because I went with my daughters, or  who who  were had gotten into the books, and read the books and really  you know, were a fan of Harry Potter.   So  my my  review is based off of someone who is not a true Harry Potter fanatic. Okay, but went to go see a movie with a daughter that enjoyed it  that it was a fanatic. But, so I want to give you my perspective from the other side of it.  I did not read the books.  I have seen all the movies, I did state that.  What I found with this movie, one it was two hours and thirty minutes long, which was a tad bit long for me.  Because most of the, most of the  time in the first thirty minutes, I was trying to figure out who these people were. How they related to each other, and they did talk about things that happened in prior movies, and I vaguely remember. And if I had read the book, obviously I would know the whole story up to this point in time. Because what I'm, whatever number this movie is, it is a, it is the next segment in the  in the series of of  movies. So I did understand that you, you can't just walk in and say, and expect to catch up with everything. It doesn't start from the beginning. It's, picks up pretty much, I guess where it left off of the other one. So this   was a  little bit of a hindrance for me, because like you said for thirty minutes I was trying to remember who was that person. How did they relate? Who was that for? Were they a good guy or a bad guy?  They looked familiar, those type of things. So I had a little bit, you know, trouble catching up with that. The movie itself was fun, it was enjoyable. It was action packed. It moved along very well.  Again, it was just the thinking behind it, the story behind it, I didn't carry it as well as I needed to. So maybe I should have watched the other Harry Potter movies before I went.  I definitely, if you ever get into it. Read the book, cause the book will definitely tell you what you need to know. I just however was not going to read that book before I watched the movie. So you know, it was enjoy, more enjoyable for my family who've read the books.  It was not, wasn't  quite as enjoyable for me. So, it's just okay.  I probably would not go see it again because, again, I I  until I have some background information, it just really wouldn't work for me that way. Okay, that was Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince. Thanks.	3.786
Hi expotv, today I'm going to review for you the movie Paper Heart.  This movie is rated PG-thirteen, it just came out this past Friday, it's in selected theaters.   It's a really good movie, I loved this movie.  It stars Charlyne Yi who had like a bit part in Knocked Up and Michael Cera who's been in a lot of movies like Superbad and Juno, he was in Arrested Development the TV show.  And then there's some other people in there but they're pretty much the main characters.  It's basically Charlyne and one of her friends is doing sort of a fake documentary.   There's parts of it that are a a real documentary that they were doing, it's about love and it's the, the  basic story is that she's somebody who doesn't believe in love and, and  doesn't think she'll ever fall in love, so she sets out to see if they can make her believe in love or, you know, anything like that. And so they her and her friend go around interviewing people around the country and those parts are real.  People tell their stories about how they fell in love or what they think about love and  it's really good but then a  over the course of them filming this comes in the story, and it's how she meets  Michael Cera and they sort of, sort of fall in love, they start dating,  and then it follows them around. I won't give away the ending  but that's what the movie's about. It's really funny, it was really funny and really cute. I loved it.  It's rated PG-thirteen, there's some cursing in it but it's not anything major.  There's really nothing in it I think that's bad for for  young teenagers to see at all.  It was a really good movie, like I said it's very cute.  And I would recommend this movie to anybody, it's out in theaters now. It is called Paper Heart.	4.435
Hi. I'm here to talk about the movie Halloween two  that just came out a couple days ago. It's a Rob Zombie movie, a continuation of Halloween one, which was in theaters a few years ago.  It starts off  a year after Laurie kills  Michael, or thinks she kills Michael. And it's the next Halloween after. And in this movie, you kind of see that, you know, no, he hasn't actually died and he's still looking for her. And it's kind of a journey into her own madness, like, her own insanity. You see her kind of, her life obviously unraveled since the brutal murders of almost everybody in her life and the attempted murder of herself. And it just gets more brutal and more brutal as he keeps trying to catch up with her and find her and make his family complete because his mother is  trying to make him complete the family. And  it's one of the most brutal horror movies I have ever seen in my entire life. I don't even remember what the body count was. It was so violent, so scary. And I'm not someone who is scared by movies easily. Like, there are lots of flashback scenes, lots of dream sequences. It was beautifully done.  It's a great continuation of the first movie.  The ending is totally frightening. It's it's   amazing. I can't, I'm a huge horror movie fan, and I really thought this was true to the original Halloween movies. And just so scary. And the graphics are so realistic.  But, yeah, it's amazing and it is really frightening. So if you want a good scare,  I would recommend this movie, but not if you have a sensitive stomach. So go see Halloween two.	5.354
Hi, I'm here to talk about the movie Inglourious Basterds.  It is a Quentin Tarantino movie. It is about a group of Jewish  soldiers led by Brad Pitt that go into Germany in World War Two and attempt to  kill Hitler and take out as many Nazis  while they can, including scalping them. And it is  a great  it's so Tarantino. There is various plotlines going on at the same time. Just as this plotline is going on there's another plotline of  a Jewish  refugee or   a Jewish girl living  under an assumed named who owns a theater that ends up have a nazi night and  she plots to kill a bunch of Nazis too.  It's not at all historically accurate but  it's a, it's an  absolutely great film. Just stunning dialogue in so many languages. I think there's there's  English, there's French, there's German in it and just amazing acting all around.  Just an outstanding cast. Not only do the leads like Brad Pitt and  Diana Kruger, or Diane Kruger,  just shine but every single actor in that movie is just absolutely perfect. And it's, it's  really brutal too. There are a lot of really brutal scalping scenes and  it's just  it's if you're a Tarantino fan you're obviously going to fall in love with it but if you're and you're a history fan you will probably fall in love with it even though it's wrong, or it's it's  inaccurate. But  yes, absolutely great. It's stunningly  it's probably the most  rich visual movie that he's ever made so far.  The the  places where it's filmed are just beautiful and  everything, every character is so well developed and it's just an amazing movie so I'd highly recommend Ingloruious Basterds to  pretty much everybody. So I  highly recommend it.	5.745

You'll love this movie too, just as funny.  and don't want to give away too much but near the three quarters the way through the movie there is a great cameo which everybody enjoys   and  it's just a really fun movie it had some great visual, some great special effects with  the main characters rules how to survive Zombieland and so if you like Shawn of the Dead, if you like zombie movies if you like comedies I definitely recommend this.

I am going to review Twilight the movie. I will say I didn't really get into the Twilight books right away.  I saw the movie first because I, it looked good from what I saw in the previews and I decided to give it a try once it came on pay per view. And I loved the movie and I decided to read the books afterward.  And I will say that  there is, you know, obviously stuff left out in the books, but it still keeps very true to the books, down to there's a scene in here in the lunchroom where you get the front cover of the book  with the two hands holding an apple.  It does have a lot of the lines in it and it is a very good movie, you know, true to life.  The characters I think were portrayed very well and   this one does have, you know, some pretty good extended features, down to the music videos, audio commentary, extended scenes, deleted scenes,   and it does show  the Comic-Con phenomenon on here  of the Twilight phenomenon and more.  So it's definitely a great, a great  movie to watch and to to  own if you've already seen it.	4.83
So this is a movie review on Inception starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.  I wasn't very excited going in to see this movie.  It was  my friend's choice to go see this movie. I hadn't even seen the previews for it. But I wasn't going to complain. And  I just, I'm very glad that this is what my friends chose to see. It was such an amazing movie. My mind was like completely blown with the, with the movie, with the twists, with everything.  I'm not really the biggest Leonardo DiCaprio fan but he did an amazing job and Joseph Gordon-Levitt is just an extremely   flexible actor, he's very versatile, he can play a lot of different roles.  Seeing him in Five Hundred Days of Summer didn't  make me believe that he was going to do a good job on such serious role as this one, but I was definitely proven wrong.  The ending, oh the ending is just, it's crazy. It leaves you on the edge of your seat and kind of angers you too. This movie gets you so, it makes you think, you know.  Inception  is explained in the movie to be  going into somebody's dream and planting an idea in their mind that grows with them. And it just like changes who they are and how they feel about life and things.  Like I said, it was an amazing movie,  definitely a five out of five. Actually it was more like a ten out of five. It was so good that it's, it's  a movie you have to see.  So definitely check that one out when you have the time.	3.464
Hi guys, so I am here today to tell you about one of my favorite holiday movies.  One of ours in our household we watch every single year Christmas eve  and sometimes twice so it is the Chevy Chase National Lampoon Christmas Vacation.  It goes along with his other movies with the other Chevy Chase movies  with his character is Clark Griswald so I'm sure you guys have heard of it or seen it. We quote this movie all the time  and and  often seeing the songs played in there for three or four days so we sing it and then the next day someone else will be singing it the next day my son will be singing it and then the next day my husband, and so on and so on and so on. So if we catch you singing this song, well we say that I am on a dork song. So  this is one of our favorite movies again it's the Chevy Chase  Christmas Vacation one {laughter} it's it's  his family and he puts up I think he puts about twenty-five thousand lights on his house  and you can see the meter spinning and spinning and spinning in the  electrical meter at the  I guess the electrical company  So the swat team is called in all kinds of crazy things happen  there's a squirrel in the Christmas tree  there's uncle Eddie which is one of by far one of my favorite characters in the movie so if you haven't seen this movie and you love Christmas movies, this is definitely a comedy Christmas movie that you would want to go see. It is a little bit older, you can tell it's a little bit dated with the fashion that is in it but, if you haven't seen it, I would definitely say go check it out. Go they have it on red box, they have it  at any stores, anywhere you can think of. So I would say go check it out. Thanks, happy holidays.	5.0
Hey everyone and welcome to Review It, by Dianna Vealy.  The holiday movie that I chose was The Polar Express.  I chose The Polar Express because this year we had a child that because he's older he thinks there is no Santa. So this year we  did some movies and this movie was one of em that I picked out.  The reason why I picked this out is because there is a child that lost his spirit about Christmas and then he was taken on a train to the North Pole and it kinda explains, you know the gist of magical Christmas.  To me, I know that there is no Santa. However I want my children to think that there is one.  This is a great material for you if you do have a child that  is stubborn and chooses not to believe.  When we watched this movie, we got to sit down, have popcorn. It was a family night event. We ordered pizza, popped popcorn, have soda, sit down, be close to each other.  This is a great movie around the holidays to enjoy your family and watch it. So I hope sometime soon that you can grab your kids and watch it yourself. Maybe you can use this for your next holiday  movie.  Thank you and have a great day.	4.123
Hello expo, this is Negative King and today I'm going to be telling you  one of my favorite gifts I got for Christmas, and that was my Inception Blu-ray DVD digital copy combo pack.  First off I'm going to say that  this is one of my favorite movies ever,  directed by  Christopher Nolan.  It stars  Leonardo DiCaprio, Ellen Page,   Joseph Gordon-Levitt and   they're pretty cool actors.  also Cillian Murphy   who's also in the Dark Knight movies.  Which Christopher Nolan also directed.  It was also the last movie that  Pete ,  what's his last name, Pete Postlethwaite   starred in after he died a few days ago.  He was one of my favorite actors so a tragic loss and this a great movie to buy to honor him.   Let me go ahead and say that   if you get this combo pack   it covers about everything that you need as far as on your Blu-ray player, DVD player, or on your computer with your digital copy.   So you get a whole bunch of bonus features on each disc and  with this little sticker on the front you take a photo with it with your cell phone and you send it to a number and it unlocks special features  such as a digital comic book on the menu after you type in a certain number, which you get from the text message.  Some really interesting stuff here, and   so you get all these bonus features on top of the movie which itself is worth it because it's one of the best movies I've seen in ages.   I highly recommend it.   If you can't afford this you can get the  just the DVD or just the Blu-ray.   Go out and get it.	4.69
Hello. This review is on Transformers Three Three-D. And my family and I went and saw it at the beginning of the summer  and we've seen a couple other three-D movies before  but they honestly weren't very good three-D wise.  But this one I have to say is definitely worth the extra money.  The movie in general  has a great story line. I liked it better than I liked the second one.  We brought our kids with us and it was clean.  It wasn't bad at all.  It was very action packed.  The three-D effects  my son even said "ahh did you see that! It hit me!" So it, it  was a really, really good movie. I would recommend it.  It's worth paying the extra few dollars to see in three-D.  But in general just the storyline is a great story line, it has a lot of action featured areas in it that  just kind of keeps you on the edge of your seat. So I would recommend going to see Transformers Three and especially in three-D if you get the chance.	6.683
