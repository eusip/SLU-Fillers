Hi, my name is Jordan and I'm gonna be reviewing the movie the DVD, Gladiator.   Now this movie came out  (uhh) a while back and before I saw it I really thought it was just gonna be a straight gore   (uhh) flick. I thought it was just gonna have lots of   (umm) lots of blood, lots of violence and that's all it was gonna be about. Well it turns out this movie's actually really really good. It has a great storyline, the actors were great, there was nothing bad about this movie. I enjoyed every bit of it.  Sometimes it can be a little bit long, but   (umm) it really was a great movie. It has   (umm) lots of action sequences in it. It does have a lot of blood and gore and stuff but it also has a great storyline. So  (umm) Ridley Scott  (umm) directed this movie and he did a great job. Everything in this movie is great. I would recommend it to anyone who likes action movies who doesn't mind seeing a little blood and gore and things like that. But   (umm) it has a great story, it even has a little bit of a love story for you know, the ladies. So  (umm) yep. But if you enjoy action movies I would definitely   (uhh) think about picking this one up.	6.351
Hi, I'm doing my video opinion for Wolf's Rain Loss. This is the third DVD in the series and it contains (uhh) four episodes episodes eleven, twelve, thirteen and fourteen.   It's very good.   It continues the story.  It keeps the (uhh)  It keeps up the expectations   that (uhh) came to be expected from the first two DVDs  of the series.  And (uhh) it introduces (umm) a couple new characters (umm) new situations and it really adds a lot to the story. You start learning more about the story.   It's a really great (uhh)  collection of the episodes on the third DVD.  And if you enjoyed the previous two DVDs, you have to continue the story.   Because (uhh) great story.  Overall  I would give it a five out of five stars because I have the previous two DVDs.  And (uhh)  It's just a great story so you have to continue the whole thing.  But some of the things that happened in the third DVD Loss are the nobles really start eating up the world with the wolves and (uhh) some things happen with (uhh) Blue, you'll know who she is from the third DVD,   and  (uhh) Quent.  They're just (uhh) great DVDs. Five out of five stars.	3.559
This DVD I have here is entitled the Italian Job. (umm) It's a very exciting film starring Charlize Theron and Edward Norton. (umm)  I really loved it, it's kind of an action movie and usually I don't like action movies that much. There is a very exciting scene where they're all driving Minis, Mini Coopers, and there's a bunch of stuff in it and they're going through all these little alleyways and down stairs, places Minis wouldn't drive and it's really cool. The boys thought that car was cool so (umm) it's a great movie if you like that car. It's very exciting. (umm) {clears throat}   I think there's been great reviews (stutter) about this movie and it's very (umm) fun to watch with friends and I have always had a fun time watching it. There's plenty of special special (stutter) features on this DVD which I really liked and  I give this five stars.	3.559
Hey ya'll how's it going? My name is Jordan and (uhh) Today I'm gonna be reviewing the DVD, The Italian Job and (uhh) this was a really really good movie.  (umm) This came out about the same time as Ocean's Eleven, which is basically a big heist movie and (uhh) this one is also a heist movie.  (umm) However, this one doesn't really have the kind of spark and energy that Ocean's Eleven had. Ocean's Eleven had a good bit of humor in it and stuff like that. This one  really probably wasn't as good as that one.  (umm) It's still a good movie. It has lots of cool scenes in it about how they were, you know stealing the money out of this guys house and stuff like that. But   (umm) it was a really good movie. I would definitely recommend it just because  (umm) it was pretty action-packed. But (umm) if you've seen Ocean's Eleven, it's gonna be a lot like that but   (umm) not as good. So (uhh) so yeah, I guess   (umm) if you go and see it or if you wanna see it then I would definitely recommend it. The special features on this DVD, they have a good bit of them. They have lots of stuff about the making of The Italian Job. It has   (umm) things about how they created the scenes and how they   (umm) made the elaborate (uhh) you know, theft  (uhh) really cool and stuff like that. It's really good DVD   (umm) just because of the amount of information that they have on it.  (umm) So really I would definitely recommend this. If ya'll don't have The Italian Job DVD, you're definitely gonna wanna go pick this up. It's a pretty good movie and it has really good special features.   (umm) So yes so ya'll go pick this up. It's called The Italian Job  (umm) and it's really really good. I think you'll enjoy it.  So (umm) ya'll go and pick this one up.	5.26
Okay right here I have one of my favorite movies. This is  Amelie. This is a two thousand one French film. It's a romance comedy.  (umm) This actually won best film at the European Movie Awards. It's about a girl named Amelie. She's   (umm) a sweet girl, naive, shy and this is basically her trying to figure out her life. Going through some changes.   (umm) She basically has a dysfunctional family and she's trying to make everyone around her happy  (umm) but then she falls in love. So it's basically about her changing into a woman and becoming happy herself. I definitely recommend this movie.   (umm) Like I said it's a romance comedy. So  a great love story but it's also pretty funny at times.  (umm)   It's a French film like I said, so it has subtitles. If you don't mind that, then I definitely think that Amelie is something that almost anybody could enjoy.  Definitely a great movie. It's called Amelie and I think you should go watch it today.	5.066
Hi, my name's Jennifer and I'm here to talk to you about the movie Girl Interrupted.   Girl Interrupted stars Winona Ryder, Angelina Jolie and Whoopie Goldberg.   Winona Ryder is a young girl who   commits herself to a mental institution   because she tried to kill herself and she   or her parents have decided they basically want to find out what's wrong.   She doesn't realize that she has a problem, she doesn't believe it at the beginning of the movie.   And it takes her a long time to figure out what is wrong with her and how to deal (stutter) with it.   Now Winona Ryder eventually finds out that she is borderline personality disorder.   And she, inside the asylum she meets Angelina Jolie who is a sociopath.   And Angelina Jolie is very destructive, basically for anyone who meets her up in, she, they just get very hurt and they just, their treatment doesn't work any more, she just   destroys everything around her and it's just not a good thing.   And Whoopie Goldberg is one of the main nurses of the clinic.   (umm) Or the asylum and she takes care of everyone   and realizes what's going on and the three of them just have great performances.   The great portrayals of (umm)   both the nursing position that Whoopie has to portray and what   Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie,   their portrayal of the illnesses that they are supposed to have.   It is a very intense movie and it's not for the younger audiences there are some very graphic scenes in it.   But for older   (umm) people especially girls,   they should see this movie and see what it's like.   (umm) It's a comment on   just mental illnesses in general,   and you can see how people learn to live with them   and how hard it can be to overcome.   And this is just a wonderful movie and it's done (umm) by Columbia Pictures and it's Girl Interrupted and I highly recommend it.   It's even the nineteen ninety nine academy award (umm) winner Angelina Jolie gets for actress in a supporting role. So just watch this movie, absolutely incredible, I think you'll all love it.	6.403
Hi. My name's Jennifer and today I'm going to talk to you about How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days.   Now this movie stars Kate Hudson and Mathew McConaughey and it is made by Paramount Pictures. It is an absolutely brilliant movie. This is my favorite romantic comedy of all time. I love Kate Hudson, Mathew McConaughey together. There's sparks flying in this movie, they're just so good together. (umm) You can really see the interaction between them. And basically Kate works for a magazine and she writes a column   how to   something in ten days. So   what she chose to do was how to lose a guy in ten days and   Mathew McConaughey wants to get a contract (umm) for the diamond   market and to do so he has to make a woman fall in love with him in ten days. So the two just happen to meet and (umm) they're paired up together   and she's trying to drive him away and he's trying to woo her over. So it's just a battle of who can win. Can she lose him or can he make her fall in love with him? It's just very funny the way Kate Hudson just dominates (umm) being the woman of the relationship. At first she's just so great and then she does everything she knows guys hate. It's so great, cause everyone knows the classic cliches. (umm) Calling twenty times a day or talking baby talk or just putting stuffed animals all over his apartment. Things like that, and she's so great. And Mathew McConaughey is just the most frustrated man and he plays it so well, and they're both  such good actors and actresses so I definitely recommend Kate Hudson Mathew McConaughey's How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days by Paramount Pictures.	7.0
Hi,   (umm) I'm reviewing  right now  (uhh) the movie Donnie Darko.  (umm) This is a really goo sci-fi time travel movie. It's very cool, it's definitely   (umm) like, a a (stutter) cult classic kind of thing I guess.  (uhh) It's, Jake Gyllenhaal is in here, which   (umm) I don't know if this is one of his first movies or anything like that, but he does a great job in here.  (umm) and   (uhh) the the (stutter) movie itself is just really freaky and (stutter) it's really cool. I guess like a self sacrificing kind of moral to the story.    (umm) And   (uhh) a lot of the things that happen here are just like, just really like  I don't know, it's it's (stutter) a very dark and scary movie as well, which is really cool.  (umm) I definitely think you could pick this up at Amazon dot com or like Borders's or anywhere like that they sell DVD's for pretty cheap because it's it's (stutter) not a new movie by any means.  (umm) But if you haven't seen Donnie Darko  (uhh) I definitely recommend going and   (uhh) like rent it or buy it somewhere if you can.   (uhh) It's definitely a good movie to see.	3.0
This is a review for (uhh) The Boondock Saints.   It's a (umm) action movie. (umm) Some people sort of (uhh) compare it to Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.   (uhh) It's (stutter) a good movie. I would recommend it (uhh) for anyone that likes those type of movies (uhh) it's got some good actors in it and it's Willem Dafoe.   (umm)   It, it's (stutter) a tremendously   violent, somewhat gory, a little bit of nudity in it I think they give it an R rating,   (uhh) which is (uhh) you know, fairly warranted. (uhh)   It's ninety-seven minutes long (uhh) so it's not a super long movie, not super short.   (uhh) But it's, it's (stutter) good in that it   keeps you on your toes, there's a little plot twist, it's well directed, it's got a nice (uhh)   style to it, it's you know,   (uhh) got it, a certain feel to it that (uhh) it just makes it a good movie, I (uhh) recommend it for that. (uhh)   {cough} (stutter) The movie hasn't been (uhh) I believe it wasn't given a theatrical release and so most people haven't seen it. (uhh)   I'm not sure why but I think it definitely warrants (uhh)   watching it.	5.745
Hey, how you doing? My name is Roger. I want to tell you a little bit about this movie called Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Now this is a little bit older movie, it got made and come out in nineteen-eighty-six so, you know, it's a good twenty years old but I will tell you it's one of the funniest movies (umm) that still appeals to young people as well as people like older people who've seen, who saw it twenty years ago.  And it's about this teenager who, you know, has,   you know he's just got it, he's got it made. Everything he does turns to gold, he's the golden child type person and he skips school that day. And it's just about his day off and his escapades and the people that are around him and what happens to them and it's just a funny, funny movie. (umm) Matthew Broderick, you know, he's obviously a teenager back at this point in time. (umm) (stutter)  I'm thinking this is probably one of the movies that put him on the, on the (stutter) charts that people really saw him and (umm),   you know, what he could do. He just did a spectacular job. (umm) Jennifer Grey is in this and there's a couple other people that you, that you (stutter) kind of see that,   you know, now they're a little bit more famous actors but back then, you know, they were just starting out and it was just a fun movie to watch. It's rated PG-thirteen (umm) you know, because I think it has a little bit of language in it and (uhh), you know a little bit of, just a little bit of older subject matter but I tell you what, for teenagers, for older kids, for even the family movies this would be a good movie to watch. It's fun, it's it's (stutter) funny, it's got some good comedy in it (umm) and it's just about the escapades of a teenager for the day. (umm) It's a good movie to take a look at. (umm)   You know, like I said it's called Ferris Bueller's Day Off and it stars Matthew Broderick.	6.055
Hey everybody. My name is Jordan and (uhh) today I will be reviewing the DVD, the   Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood now wait a second, now wait a second, I know the guys are just, like what in the world, I seen a lot of movies, (umm)   I'm willing to watch a movie once for sure I mean anytime, I'm gonna watch a movie. (umm)   But,  and I always give it the best, you know, benefit of the doubt and like I'm going to sit down and watch this movie I'm going to enjoy it  you know. If I don't like it, I don't like it, I don't have to watch it again, if I like it, I'll watch it again.   Well this is one I will probably not watch again.   (umm) Guys, nobody,  you really wouldn't care about this. I really don't think guys will really care about this movie at all.   Girls, if you're looking for a birthday present to get your boyfriend or something like that,   you would probably want to mark this off your list definitely and (uhh)   guys but guys if if (stutter) you're looking for a good movie to give your girlfriend and that's not that expensive, then this will definitely be a good one. (umm) The movie itself, it's it's (stutter) geared, you know, not for guys, it's not action packed or anything like that,   (umm) it's not really that interesting, it's just a lot   drama stuff, I mean, I just, I just (stutter) didn't like it at all.  (umm) Special features, I mean, they have (uhh) commentary, stuff like that but, I mean, I wasn't even interested in watching them because, I mean, who would really want to watch commentary on something that they didn't like in the first place.   So (umm)  so yes so, guys, this would be a good movie for your girlfriend just make sure she knows, that you know, you're not gonna watch it with her except for one time.   (umm) Girls, don't get this for your guy friends, they they (stutter) won't like it.  (umm) Yes but so, so (stutter) guys get it for your girlfriends   and girls get it for yourself but, anything other than that, you probably wanna skip over it. So.	6.351
I'm here to present to you Man of the Year starring Robin Williams.   (uhh) It also has the supporting characters of Lewis (stutter) Black and Christopher Walken (stutter) and Jeff Goldblum.   But they're just the supporting characters the other two main characters   Laura Linney and the guy that plays the evil face of delacorp, the company that   (umm)   the company that causes most of the conflict through this movie.   Weren't really people I identified.   So (uhh) if you're watching this for the comedy aspects,   (uhh) it's kind of few and far between but they are funny I will say that, the, (stutter) whenever they try to be funny they are funny.   But then there are just parts where it gets so dark and so dramatic that   (umm) it just kinda overshadows any comedy that's there and just eventually becomes a straight   (uhh) suspense drama you know.   (umm)   Like I had complete expectations of seeing Robin Williams (uhh) stand up.   (uhh) I've seen some of the comedy works he done (uhh) classic tv shows he's done.   But this movie is just (uhh)   it's,   it's kind of got a conflict of interest in the story.   See the whole story behind this movie is,   that Robin Williams plays a character named Tom Dobbs who has a politically charged   (uhh) television show, a talk show.   Where   he'll (uhh) express his opinions obviously   (uhh) much like (uhh) Jon Stewart of the Daily Show or Steve Colbert of the Colbert Report.   But   (uhh) he   tongue in cheekingly   (uhh) claims that he's going to   run for president.   And,   and this is after an audience,   (uhh) an audience member on one of his shows tells him to do this   he decides to go through with it.   So he does, he runs for president and he actually gets into the,   into the into the (stutter) voting system.   And (uhh) that's where the point is that earlier in the movie   they showed there was a glitch in the voting system.   That the movie is based around the idea that this company has created this voting system that will streamline voting making it easier   for the for the (stutter) voter to just go in and just   hit a few (stutter) buttons and their vote's counted.   (uhh) But a glitch is discovered early on in the movie   but instead of fixing it   they create this big (uhh) this big conspiracy story to cover it up.   (uhh) There are a lot of elements of that which is actually what ruined the movie for me is it took it away from the comedy and made it more of a (uhh) (uhh) (uhh) the seedy underbelly of,   of politics which obviously we know is there,   but I just, I just wanted something about politics that didn't present that for once that actually just gave you a a (stutter) here's a a (stutter) silly,   tongue in cheek rendition of what would happen if a comedian became president   here's the country now,   you know. I mean some people think yeah but that would just be Idiocracy you know, which Mike Judge did that movie, but no, it wouldn't I mean Robin Williams has a lot of great points   in his stand up his character also has a lot of great points which reflects.   But   just the direction they went with it just showed a lack of creativity   and they just decided to go with the paranoia angle instead of the comedy angle,   which I think they should have focused on.   But   (umm)   the lengths that the company goes to,   the company by the way with the   unnamed face of   I believe the character's name is Matthias played by Dan Murray who's the kind of the face of Delacorp that makes sure everything goes the, according to plan.   And his (uhh) representatives played by Jeff Goldblum.   So at least you get good actors out of it I mean Robin Williams, Lewis Black, Christopher Walken.   (uhh) Which also brings in more (uhh) dramatic elements you know kind of   Rocky Balboa ish you know, you know push this issue   because I'm going through and you'll see this, you'll see this in the movie.   (uhh)   (uhh) Laura Linney Jeff Goldblum,   (uhh) Delacorp employees and   Dan Murray as Matthias playing the lead   (uhh) face of Delacorp.   But   honestly   this movie just does not measure up, I did not, I didn't like it.   I liked the comedy elements I liked what he had to say I like how he handled the debate.   But pretty much everything (uhh)   every other character did other than Christopher Walken or Lewis Black I didn't like.   (uhh) It was basically just a comedian's go,   and have a good time and they make the movie enjoyable and then everybody else went in and mucked up the works.	6.683
I'm gonna do a video review today on the movie Escape to Witch Mountain.  This movie is a great movie to watch. It's ninety seven minutes long and you wish there were more minutes added to it cause it's such a good movie.  And it's about two little kids, a brother and a sister, that have brain power.  They can move stuff,  they can float, they can do all kinds of cool stuff and it's just a cool movie to watch, especially if you're a little kid.  And what's good about this is, this particular movie has special features.  It has a audio commentary with Ike Eisman, John Hu and Kim Richards, they were actors in the movie.  It also has a cartoon, Pluto's Dream House, that's included in the movie.  (uhh) Making the escape, they have the making of the movie. It's all on this one DVD.  It has a nineteen seventy five Disney Studio album.  It has a conversation with John Hu.  (uhh) It's digitally mastered and it has special effects, something that the first movie didn't have.  So I highly recommend this movie.  And probably the best place to get this, since it's a Disney DVD   and they don't always have these available in stores. They'll put em out every so often to celebrate anniversaries or whatever.   But you can go to DisneyDVD dot com to pick this movie up, and I highly recommend it.	3.786
This is Children of Men the HD-DVD combo disc. Now this just came out   and in fact is actually very difficult to find in most stores. (umm)   Only my Best Buy had it in stock.   Target and a whole bunch of other places including Amazon for some reason are having problems with the supply I'm not sure if it was just (uhh) a limited release   or whatever but it seems to be very, very popular with good reason, cuz this was an excellent film.   It's heavily stylized, it's set in the future. And the future (umm)   the story or the basic premise of it anyways is that for some reason, people stopped having children and no one's sure why and   no one's had any children for I don't if it was fifteen, eighteen, whatever years. And children of men,   well I'm not gonna go into the story any more than that, but it's just an excellent film.   Including some stunning sequences that just look absolutely beautiful in high def. There's one sequence that's an action sequence with the military attacking an apartment building   that's almost a four minute long shot with no cuts, and it goes everywhere around the building and it's just very, very impressive.   So (umm)   the supplements are all right I wouldn't (uhh) nothing to write home about, really.   And yes so the video quality, the audio quality's excellent. The supplements could be a little better   but this movie is so good that doesn't even, that shouldn't even really matter. I'm going to give Children of Men the HD-DVD a solid five out of five.	5.745
Hi. Today I'm presenting a movie opinion on the DVD office Space.   This movie gets a ten out of ten from me, it's a great comedy.   (umm) It's about this guy who hates his job, he works in like (uhh)   like tech company and he works in a cubicle all day, and his boss  sucks and so he one day he gets hypnotized and the hypnosis guy pretty much convinces him that he shouldn't care about life. So he just does whatever he wants, goes to work when he wants, does what he wants at all times. And there's all these funny things going on, the other characters make it really funny too. (umm)  So definitely use (uhh) get (stutter) or rent Office Space. It's a great DVD. (umm)   It didn't really go big in theaters so you may not have heard of it, but it's really big on DVD.   (uhh) It also has this other character named Milton in it who is hilarious, and  the (stutter) the DVD also has like special bloopers and deleted scenes and DVD commentary.   So go rent or buy Office Space the DVD.	5.099
Hi.   (umm) today, the product that I'm going to review is a DVD. This is a double-feature DVD. It's Star Wars  the (umm) Ewok Adventures.  Now, (umm), like I said, it has two xxx. It has (stutter) (umm) two features. The first is The Caravan of Courage and then the other one is The Battle of Endor.   And (umm)   this is  the first one, the Caravan of Courage follows a family (umm) who has their  spaceship has crash landed on  I guess on the planet xxx, or (umm) populated by Ewoks.  And the the (stutter) mother and father of the young boy and girl have been captured (stutter) by almost an evil sorcerers.  And (uhh)   it's there  they happen to be captured by Ewoks and are taken to their village. And then the Ewoks help them find their parents and to rescue them. The Battle of Endor is where (umm) the young boy and girl helped by the Ewoks try to leave   (umm)  the planet, but something happens (umm) and there's a great battle, their parents die, and then they're trying to fight and (uhh) survive.  (uhh)  in that village where Ewoks live. You can find this at (uhh) Amazon dot com or even eBay for under twenty dollars.	3.162
Today I'm reviewing Snakes On A Plane.   (uhh)   Pretty funny movie, (uhh) pretty corny movie actually. (umm) I'm very surprised that a actor notorious as Samuel L. Jackson would agree to do a movie quite like this.   (uhh) I guess you know money's money so if you get paid for this movie you get paid for something else and you don't really have to try to act too hard in this movie.   (uhh) Basically starts out,   a guy witnesses a murder. Samuel L. Jackson's an FBI agent, gonna protect him.   (uhh) And then they get on a plane and   the (uhh) the mobsters try to put snakes on a plane to kill everybody.   Is basically how the movie you know, starts out.   (uhh) Personally   I thought it was pretty (uhh)   it was just really corny, and I mean it's kind of interesting to see what they could possibly do with snakes on a plane.   (uhh) I could see like maybe like attack eagles on a plane, because you know, eagles fly and planes fly but like snakes on planes you just,   it's a concept that's really out there.   (uhh) And then the snakes, it's just, it's kind of a more low budget film, the CG snakes, computer generated so they're not very realistic.   (uhh) I wouldn't really recommend wasting money on this (uhh) if you have it and you wanna rent it or a friend owns it you wanna borrow it and that would be cool but don't go buy this.	4.69
I'm reviewing the movie Inner Space.   This is VHS cassette but they also have (umm) a DVD. But this movie is a is a (stutter) good movie. There's (uhh)   a little bit of language but it's it's (stutter)rated PG.   (umm) it's nothing (stutter), the language is not bad at all. I mean  depends on how you are with language. But (uhh) it's in color, it's a hundred and twenty minutes. (umm) It's got (uhh)  Meg Ryan  and Dennis Quaid in this movie and (uhh) I recommend this movie. It's funny, it's action packed,   and (uhh) it's a good storyline. But you can get this from Amazon dot com  for probably under five dollars since it's VHS or, you know, you could also get the DVD probably under ten. But I recommend this movie, it's (uhh) it's a cute movie. Even kids would like this.   So again it's Inner Space and it's a Steven Spielberg film.	3.317
Hey there Expo TV goers.  I just witnessed a terrible movie that was called TMNT, or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as they used to call it when it was good.  This is a computer animated version of our beloved turtles and it is nowhere near as good as those great, early nineties, real life Ninja Turtles cheese fests.  This Turtles movie is terrible and it has the worst plot and cliche, collecting orbs and stuff  xxx I've ever seen in my life.  And there's (uhh)  the chick is like  has like a staff and she hits people with it.  And I hated it and animation was pretty terrible. Looks like a video game cut scene, with the exception of one rain fight which was pretty cool.  (umm) All the catch phrases were there, Splinter was there, he was cool, but  I didn't really like it.   So, don't see it. Bye.	4.69
Hi, ExpoTV. This is user QTPie. I'm reviewing a movie starring the hottest guy in the world. And many of you girls out there who are at, do ExpoTV probably know this, but it's Bill Murray, right? He's so hot. This movie is Groundhog Day. And it's a romance movie. It's starring Bill Murray and this other girl. I think she's on (umm) Seinfeld. I don't know, though. That looks like her, right, from Seinfeld?  She's a really good actress, and this movie is hilarious. (stutter) Of course it is. I mean, it's got Bill Murray, right? This movie is PG-thirteen, though. It's made by Columbia Pictures. And basically what this movie is about is, like, every day, Bill Murray wakes up and it's like a different time period. Or, no, every day he wakes up and it's the same day that keeps going on and on in every piece. Every day, he goes to sleep and it's the same day after that. But (stutter) him and this girl fall in love every day and they always forget until he breaks the spell. And it's a good movie. I recommend it.	3.162
Howdy guys, this is Cade and this is me doing a review of the Director's Cut DVD version of Bladerunner. (uhh) this is a classic science fiction film. You've got Harrison Ford playing this character that initially hunts down renegade robots in the future when there is like, a lot of population is cyborg or what not.   And a bunch of these cyborgs actually go and wreak havoc on the future city, you see here is some crazy stuff going on. You got some floating cars and what not and crazy buildings.   (umm) Among other people in this, Darryl Hannah's in this. Also, Edward James Olmos and Sean Young as well as (uhh)  Rutger Hauer. I'm not sure if that's how you pronounce his last name, but he's like a creepy German guy that's in a whole lot like, Steven Segal movies and stuff like that. This guy.  So like I said, this is regarded as a classic. If you've never heard of it or never seen it then obviously you should. But it's definitely one of the best science fiction movies out there. It's very suspenseful and very cool and edgy.   xxx and there's something sort of goth about it as well. And this is the director's cut which means it's a lot more footage and this is how the director wanted it.  Five out of five stars. Definitely one of my favorite movies of all time.	5.354
Hello. (uhh) Today we've got Letter from Iwo Jima here   and this a wonderful HD-DVD. This is the second part of the other one I was, I did, Flags of Our Fathers review. (uhh) I say second part because these two movies go hand in hand, this is like a companion piece to that film. (umm)  But (uhh) it's a great HD-DVD and it's also a better film than the actual, than Flags of Our Fathers but (uhh) both of them are worth seeing, both of them are worth picking or renting to see what you think of them. (uhh) This is,   it's from the same director, from Clint Eastwood, it came out the same year, they were filmed back to back. And this one instead of focusing on the American perspective of the Battle of Iwo Jima this (uhh) focuses on the Japanese perspective and the entire film's in Japanese and (uhh) there's not really that many American cast members in it. (uhh) Then you know there's a few but there's not really any, and none of them are from Flags of our Fathers.  (umm) But it's rated R for graphic war violence and that's about it. There's really no cursing in it and there's no, you know, it's really just blood and stuff. But (uhh) the film is fantastic, (uhh) it has some great, great uh (stutter) you know performances in there from Ken Watanabe, he's the best  (uhh) in the picture. (umm)   But really it's just really worth checking out. (uhh) Watch Flags of Our Fathers first because it's kind of more interesting to see how, you know, the winning side first and then see the losing side and what they had to go through. (uhh) You definitely feel for all the characters and (umm) but (uhh) really, you know, there's nothing, there's nothing (stutter) to complain about this film, I really enjoy it. It also got nominated for (uhh) best picture. It didn't win but it got nominated,   it's certainly an honor. And (umm) and (uhh) the the (stutter) for the HD-DVD it's a combo disc (uhh) so you flip it over you can use it on a regular (umm)  DVD player. And (umm) the the (stutter) one side, the actual DVD version, doesn't have any special features except for a few previews. But (uhh) this has (uhh) on the HD-DVD side there are a lot of special features on there. (umm)  Actually from the two disc DVD version, not this version. But (uhh) this version has those special features in HD (umm) and it's very much worth checking out and I definitely say pick both of them up and (uhh) really it's just probably also one of my favorite films of two-thousand-six along with Children of Men   and Pan's Labyrinth. So (uhh) definitely, definitely try and check this movie out cause it's you won't regret it and it's definitely worth seeing.   So yeah.	5.354
Hey ExpoTV, how are you doing today? I'm going to review one of my favorite movies of all time, this is Heat. It is a Michael Mann film, and it has two of the greatest actors of all time playing on the (uhh) same movie: Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. This is your average cops-and-robbers film, but it's not so average. I believe it's one of the best, if not the best, cops-and-robbers good guy-bad buy film of all time. Al Pacino plays a detective and Robert De Niro plays the (uhh) bad guy who is doing all these heists. And it is a great movie, a little long, three hours, but it definitely packs a punch.   Supporting cast is great. You have Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, Ashley Judd, Natalie Portman. Dennis Haysbert makes a small role in here. You all know him from the Allstate commercials and for being the ex-president on twenty four. Overall, I would give this movie a five out of five. Definitely watch this movie multiple times. I was first brought to this movie when I was at film camp from North Carolina School of the Arts. We were supposed to watch Bridge on the River Kwai. Our TA instead let us show Heat. I'm glad he did. This is one of my all-time favorite movies.  And this right here is the two-disc special edition. It came out about two years ago in two thousand five. ten years after the movie was released in theaters. And you get a lot of special features on the movie. You have eleven additional scenes, five new making documentaries. (uhh) They were, they go back to L.A. There (stutter) are shooting locations. It talks about the script, how it was developed, how it became Heat. And basically, it actually has Al Pacino and De Niro. There's a famous scene where they meet in the coffee shop.   A lot of rumors swirling around the Internet that Pacino and De Niro were there on different days, they were not actually there filming at the same time. But, believe it or not, that rumor is actually dispelled. They were, believe it or not, Pacino and De Niro, rivals, together in one scene at the same time.  Definitely a great film. If you have not seen this, I highly recommend this. A lot for the guys, definitely want to pick this up. Great action film. Great heist scene. I'm sure you all remember Dane Cook talking about this. {noise} Where's the van? {noise} you know in his comedy thing. Definitely a great movie.  This is Heat.	6.055
And (uhh) Little Man definitely a funny movie. It's PG thirteen and it's got the Wayans brothers in there. This one's got Marlon Wayans   and  Shawn Wayans   So we like them brothers, they're pretty funny guys, but anyways.   It's about (uhh) this jewel thief that decides that he's gonna steal a jewel and he  he's a little guy. He's probably just a couple feet high and (uhh) he  steals the jewel, hides the jewel, and   has to get this jewel back and it  winds up in a couple's home and the funny thing is this couple happens to be wanting a child so his way to get into the home was to dress up like a baby and place himself in a basket so they'll take him in and take care of him. So (uhh) it's it's (stutter) a crazy little film. A funny,  crazy, crazy funny but (uhh) I was liking it watching it. It is PG thirteen and   {laugh} you would like it.	2.38
Hey expotv. I'm Dia, and   this right here is   The Hot Chick. This is not the kind of movie that I would normally watch. I only really watched it because my sister and my cousin were like oh my god this movie is so funny, you gotta see it. And I didn't really have anything else to do so I kind of sat down and I watched it with them. And the fact is that it was pretty funny, but it was funny in that sort of like mindless comedy kind of way where it's not very smart, but it can be pretty funny and like (stutter) at some points it's kind of cute and, you know, it has a point or a moral.   So you can't hate it   because it's not, it's not (stutter) complete garbage but it's not exactly like, you know, the best movie you've ever seen. But like I said it was fun to watch. (umm)   The whole premise of the movie is that Rob Schneider and (uhh) I can't remember the actress's name. I believe it's the girl who's in Mean Girl. Rachel McAdams, is that her? She, they switch bodies and (umm) you know hilarity ensues. She she (stutter) who's in his body has to convince everybody that it's still her and, like I said, funny but I wouldn't buy it. Like if it's on Comedy Central I would suggest that you go ahead and check it out, but you know otherwise it's not exactly something that you need to add to your video collection.	7.0
Today we're gonna take a look at National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon one.   (uhh) It's a comedy movie.  (uhh) It's sort of a parody of Lethal Weapon.  (uhh) If you've ever seen that, then you'll probably love this one  if you can handle the parody. It does star Emilio Estevez and Samuel L. Jackson.  But I think Samuel L. Jackson is great in this movie as is Emilio Estevez. So if you're a fan of either of them, you'll love this movie.   (uhh) It has a widescreen and full screen versions on the DVD. So they're both on the same DVD, you don't have to switch sides or anything like that.   I think this movie's absolutely hilarious but, at the same time  (uhh) you might not enjoy it if you're not a fan of say, The Naked Gun series or anything involving Leslie Nielsen. It's a movie in that style for sure.  (uhh) Once again, that's National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon one and I recommend this movie, I think you should check it out. It does have five point one surround sound and regular surround sound if your system supports that. So, check it out.	5.354
Today we're gonna check out Mission: Impossible two, starring Tom Cruise.  (uhh) Honestly I thought this movie sucked.  (uhh) Mission Impossible one, I thought was much better  (uhh) because it was actually (uhh) it had a good plot. It was interesting and it wasn't just there   (uhh) to to (stutter) throw in as much action as possible. It was a a (stutter) true spy movie.  This one (uhh) is to me, pretty much ridiculous and it seems as though, they were just trying to make it as extreme as possible  and that is definitely the truth in one scene where (uhh) Tom Cruise  (uhh) is riding through some  flames on his motorcycle doing a nose wheelie and stuff like that. I mean just look at the cover.  Look at that.  That's how extreme this is. It's a little too extreme for my taste. But if you like kind of dumbed down action movies then this is for you. Otherwise, (uhh) I don't recommend this movie.	6.055
Hi.   Today I am reviewing the   Walt Disney classic DVD special edition Beauty and the Beast.  (umm) This is the platinum edition. (umm)  It's some of (umm)  the world's favorite   (umm) cartoon movie.   (umm) It's totally awesome. (umm) I'm sure most of you have seen Beauty and the Beast  (umm) but this is awesome and it's a special edition.   (umm) I really liked this because it was one of my favorite movies growing up,  (umm) as a kid growing up.  (umm) But yeah it's definitely awesome.  (umm) But yeah, it's really cool.  (umm) It has a lot of enhanced stuff.  (umm) It's three different versions of the movie on here.  (umm) They just kind of (uhh) I guess restored the  the old favorite that we all know and love.  (umm) But it's awesome.  (umm) It's a great story.  (umm) I'm sure most of you have seen it basically.   (umm) It's about Belle and (uhh) basically she falls in love with the Beast. Which everyones pretty much scared of and stuff, but anyways.  (umm) But yeah, that's that (stutter) really sums it up, but it's great. Lots of fun characters. Everything comes to life and (uhh) just a wonderful movie.  (umm) Got this at Best Buy (umm) for twenty dollars.   (umm) I give it five out of five stars definitely. You should go check it out. Walt Disney has plenty of great DVDs and I love how they're restoring   (umm) the classics and what not. But I give it five out of five stars. So go check out the new platinum edition of Beauty and the Beast.  Oh, and this is for kids.  (umm) Kids and everyone can love it. It is rated G though.   Thank you.	3.559
I really like a lot of films that are funny when they're not supposed to be. Films that you can just sit and laugh at.  One such film: Road House,    starring Patrick Swayze.   It's about a bouncer (uhh) with a philosophical take on life. Actually he has a (uhh) Ph.D. in philosophy from a major university.  Yet somehow he enjoys beating the crap out of a bunch of people for a living.  {clears throat}  In this film he goes to a bar that is  pretty sketchy and needs to be cleaned up.  His first night he fires half the crew and whips the rest of the crew into shape.  (umm)  Patrick Swayze, also known as the world's most shirtless man, is, (umm)  his performance is hammy, cheesy, over the top. and all out horrible.  (uhh) The only acting performance in the film that I think is,  is (stutter) played as to what a be is Sam Elliott, otherwise known as the voice of the American Beef Council.  He's the face of grizzle, and of course he comes in with his five o'clock shadow from about, oh, three weeks ago and (umm)  rides up on a Harley, proceeds to beat the crap out of a bunch of other people.  (uhh) His performance is comical yet it was supposed to be.  (uhh) All in all if you're looking for something serious (stutter) do not watch this film. If you're wanting something you can laugh at, yeah, pick it up.	7.0
Today I'm reviewing The Good Shepherd on High Definition DVD and regular DVD.  (umm) This is a special edition kind of thing where you get it in HD format, then on the other side it's in regular DVD so you don't always need an HD DVD player to play it. You can go take it over to your friend's house. But anyway, The Good Shepherd, it   (umm) it's a really great movie. The story line, it's a it's (stutter) about the (umm) the creation of the central intelligence agency, (uhh) back in the sixties, and they talked about the Bay of Pigs invasion and how the CIA started. So if you're really into, you know spy movies or spy novels or things like you know, the military industrial complex, or government or politics, political issues, it's really, you'll really love this movie. But if you're, even if you're you know, a girl or something or you like all the, you know family stuff and you know, the boyfriend girlfriend troubled marriage stuff, there's a lot of this in here too because the people who work for the CIA, at least in this movie, are (umm)  pretty intense and pretty dedicated to their work which obviously caused problems back at home. So it's it's (stutter) really for everybody. It's a great movie. It's one of those things that everybody should see. So, go get it.	4.69
Hey, this is a (uhh) review of Hot Fuzz  which  is, I think, still in theaters and (uhh)  {sigh} stars the two gentlemen from  (uhh) Shaun of the Dead and it's, it's (stutter) very similar. If you liked (uhh) Shaun of the Dead  you'll like  Hot Fuzz, and if you've never seen Shaun of the Dead you probably should because it will change your life. (umm)  It's  well kind of mocking action movies is actually does a better job  than many action movies do, just  by not being completely ridiculous.  And (uhh) it's got a good story,  it's got (uhh) good special effects, it's got great characters.  You actually care about them. (umm)   Yeah, it's definitely a movie that you need to see. (uhh)  I give it five out of five and I'll buy it on DVD when it hopefully comes out.	2.0
Hi I'm Tom and I'm reviewing broken lizards Club Dread. This movie is very bad I'm giving it two out of five stars.   I loved broken lizards' first two films,   Puddle Cruiser and   Supertroopers. They were both really, really funny.   Supertroopers is one of my favorite movies and I'm really glad to know they're now making a sequel.   However this movie is not   anywhere on that level, it's, it's (stutter) bad in my opinion.   It follows the broken lizard gang as they own a resort in the Caribbean.   (uhh) And it's just not very funny.   (umm) (stutter) There instead of being a cop parody, this is a horror parody   and I feel there have been enough horror parodies done the past few years and this one is not very, very good.   (uhh) There are some humorous taunt moments in it.   But overall the story is just,   you know it's just campy and it's too   cliche horror parody. (umm)   Supertroopers was still, very was still pretty realistic like yeah it's, it's (stutter) still comedy and it's far fetched.   But this people I mean, I mean (stutter) I don't know I guess you know horror is so far fetched with people come back to life but this one is just not very good.   So, two out of five stars.	4.83
So, America, I got a DVD to show you today. And it is The Italian Job  (umm) released by  Paramount Pictures. Awesome movie. And it features Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward, and Edward Norton.  (umm) Really good movie (uhh) action packed (umm)  you know, all the good stuff and (uhh) I mean, Ebert and Roper give it two thumbs up.  Really, really entertaining movie. (umm)  It's got a lot of special features on the DVD too.  It's got (umm) the making of it (umm)  driving schools, which show you how they used the Mini Cooper in the movie, which was really cool.  (umm) They have deleted scenes, stunts from the movie, (uhh) the wide-screen version, just a whole bunch of really cool stuff, plus the awesome movie.  So definitely pick up The Italian Job because it's a great movie.	4.546
Oh I don't wanna play. Winning's too hard. We're so good everybody wants us to win state. Yeah, well that's what they sound like in the movie with Billy Bob Thornton, Friday Night Lights. It's about Odessa Permia. I don't know if if (stutter) anybody watches, follows Texas football. Back in the early nineties Odessa Permia was, they're like the hot shots back when North Mesquite Stallions, Odessa Permia, that's what this is about except this was before the Stallions were awesome. This is back when (uhh) it was actually (uhh) Mesquite Carter, I think is what it was. But   I don't know. I am not a, personally I am a all-state athlete so I,  I don't understand this whole "everybody wants us to win, it's so hard" that I don't I don't, I don't (stutter) get it when people complain about stuff like that. But   it's a decent movie.   (uhh) I think it, I think it (stutter) spends too much time talking about the problems they have. It's not enough football. I was,   when I saw this I thought it's like "oh man, it's going to be a great movie cause it's gonna be about a great football team who had a great season." (umm)  No, it's not about that. And actually it's kind of funny (uhh) not many people know their story and they actually lost in that state championship football game so it really wouldn't have surprised me when they lost cause I knew that was coming. But overall  bad movie just from the simple fact that wasn't a lot of football, but if you're watching it because you want to see a drama of what it's like to see, you know, high school kids pushed to the limit for a sport, you know, and it breaks them down and, you know, even the reality of all some kids can do is play football and if they get hurt, you know, and they can't go play college they're pretty much stuck, you know, in that small Odessa town doing nothing and  that's kind of sad, and I don't want to know about that stuff, because I know it exists but no reason to see it. So Friday Night Lights, one out of five.   See it if you need to.	6.351
Hi. Today I'll be reviewing the movie Live Free or Die Hard, which just just (stutter) came out a couple of days ago while I'm reviewing this (umm).   Basically, the the (stutter) fourth movie in the Die Hard series, The Die Hard Trilogy. It used to be a trilogy. Now, it's (uhh) four movies (umm) starring Bruce Willis, and this is (umm) talks about the story of John McClain, (uhh) NYPD Cop, now he's a detective. He's not a cop anymore. (umm) And going through all these action sequences and getting into all this trouble, I mean it's really, really action packed. The movie is around, I think two to two and a half hours long, (umm) and every minute of it is action. Just a lot of action. If you love action, this is a lot of explosions, a lot of stuff crashing, a lot of helicopters, a lot of gunfire, everything. This movie is a lot of fighting. This movie has everything. Every moment is action packed. (uhh) Basically, it goes through (umm),   premise of the story is, there's this computer hacker (umm) who is trying to (uhh) like bring end of days armageddon to the United States by hacking into all like, the transportation systems, banking systems, air traffic, everything. Hacking (stutter) them and shutting them all down. The electrical systems, natural gas, heating, everything, and shutting it down. Basically, with America running on (stutter) computers, everything is run by computers. He, by way by way (stutter) of just hacking into them and shutting them down, he shut down America, basically. It's a new form of (umm) electronic (uhh) internet terrorism stuff. And here's John McClain. He's trying to (uhh) stop them.   And if you've seen the commercials, they probably captured his daughter and he has to go rescue his daughter also. So it's like a personal vendetta thing and overall it's very action packed. Highly recommend this. Five stars out of five. It's a really, really good movie, (uhh) and it's pretty good story too. It's not just action only. Blow up the bad guy. Kill the bad guy. It's a good story to it (uhh).  There's a lot of action. Every moment of it. Must have cost them hundreds of millions of dollars to make. (umm) It's a very, it's a feast for the eyes. It's a very good movie, and I highly recommend it. If (stutter) especially if you liked the previous three Die Hards Die Hards (stutter), (umm) this fourth one does not disappoint at all. So I give it five out of five stars. I highly recommend you go watch Live Free or Die Hard. Thank you.	6.403
Hey guys I'm here with a review of one of best movies ever made,  Oldboy.  (umm) It's a Korean movie based off of the  the Japanese mange  (umm) and it's (uhh) directed by (uhh)   what's his name, Park Chan-wook.   (umm) It's probably the toughest movie ever.  (uhh) It's about a man who gets imprisoned for fifteen years  (umm) and and (stutter) this this (stutter) prison is like a business where people can like have people held for as long as they pay them for. So  (umm) he's trying to find out who paid to have him imprisoned.  And there's lots of twists.  (uhh) Really tough fight scenes.  (umm) Great acting, great story, just everything about it is pretty much perfect.  (stutter) Totally five star movie.  (umm) Very violent. Very just it's probably the best revenge movie ever made.  (umm) It, I definitely recommend you see Oldboy.	5.477
I'm going to do a movie review on   Pirates of the Caribbean:   At World's End.   (umm) This movie is currently still playing in the theaters,   and (umm) I just recently watched it.   (umm) I waited a while for (uhh) everybody to you know, because people wanted to see it as soon as it came out.   I waited a while for it to die down before I went and saw it because I figured (uhh) since this is the the (stutter)  the third installment you know, usually it comes into third movies, which,   (umm) I've already done reviews on some third installment movies and,   and they kind of sometimes lack.   But when it comes to Pirates of the Caribbean the second one I didn't like.   The first one I liked a lot. The second movie kind of died off for me the way they, they killed Jack Sparrow.   And this movie starring the same characters, (uhh) (uhh)   and Johnny Depp,   (umm) Orlando Bloom and (uhh)   Keira Knightley I believe   (umm) for the names of the actors.   (umm)   It's a long movie, it's like two and a half hours maybe almost two to forty-five minutes.   So and it has a lot of action in the movie.   It (stutter) did kind of almost too much action, it, I think it numbs you after a while because it's got so much going on.   And (umm) you know, the the (stutter) kind of back and forth plot goes here, it goes there goes all over the place, there's a lot of things going on so if you're not paying attention you're gonna kind of,   kind of get lost in it.  And so.  But the, (stutter) but you know they did pretty good on the graphics.   (umm) The CG is great.   And (umm) the story's, you know, it,   it keeps you out, oh I kind of wish they would of, of (stutter) maybe split this movie up   or shortened it or something. Because this it's just, it's (stutter) almost just too much.   They try to cram everything all in at once and it, it just didn't it just didn't (stutter) cut it for me.   (umm)   There's some parts I liked, some parts I didn't, so   if I was to grade it I'd probably give it a C plus.   (umm) I know the critics didn't give it a very good grade.   But you know.   (uhh) So I didn't like the movie.	1.732
Hi there, my name is Nalin. I will be reviewing the movie in theaters Ratatouille. So Ratatouille is about (uhh)  a rat which knows how to cook and (uhh) where he got his (uhh) cooking lessons from is (uhh) is from a really big chef who owns a big restaurant in Paris. So this is the basic plot of the story that it, it (stutter) starts off as the rat who is a pretty good chef, who's passionate about cooking, and (umm)  he kind of lands into  (uhh) the hands of a guy who's,   who really needs a job and (umm)   this new job that he lands into is now as a chef. So basically the whole thing is about how this rat, the chef rat, helps this guy who doesn't know how to cook and (uhh) things things (stutter) go really complicated into that and (uhh) really it xxx into other things. But the whole movie is really, really nice. (umm)  Very good (uhh) entertainment and (uhh) very enjoyable, I rate this movie five out of five and I recommend that you should it in theaters. And (uhh) it's a really, really nice movie. Very nicely directed and (uhh) it it's (stutter) also got all these food stuff and I remember seeing a documentary about all the food that they made, they actually tried to make it look really  (umm) real. So they actually tried to make it real and it does show up very well on the  theater, so you should really go ahead and watch this movie in theaters. I rate this five out of five. Thank you.	4.69
Hi, my name is Dylan and I will review Sacha Baron Cohen's movie Borat DVD. The Borat movie was held among fans as being a very entertaining and funny movie because of it's edgy humor  and Sacha Baron Cohen's character impersonating a man from Kazakhstan.  It was real life depictions of him going to places like New York and Los Angeles and interacting with normal people in their daily lives.  (uhh) I thought it was a very good movie and it was very funny and even though it's not for the whole family, if you're with a few friends it's good for the adult crowd.  The DVD case is packed full of extra features, some of which are very nice, including one with involving Sacha which I recommend you check out if you buy the DVD  and the DVD itself is very funny. The reason being, the whole description in the back is actually in  a language similar to Russian.  So  anybody who can read Russian can actually get a a (stutter) few words out of it and I though that was very interesting and funny.  And  I think the special features alone, the extra scenes are worth it to get the movie. That's how good it is.  Also this movie is a great movie, one of the greatest (umm) ever.  So if you like the movie I would suggest getting  Borat. It was about fifteen dollars, that's not too bad. It's a good movie. So this is Borat, check it out.	2.708
Here to review the pudding of Bill Cosby, Himself.  So Bill Cosby, before he was on the Cosby Show,  and  (uhh)  that other show where he was married to the same lady Phylicia Rashad.  Was a standup comedian as most people know. And this is  one of his best standup routines.  I believe it is  how long is it.  It is a hundred-and-three minutes long.  It's pretty long, I mean it's almost a two hour  (umm) comedy show.  So funny. So funny, it's just him sitting  in a chair, sometimes he stands up  in front of a background that slowly changes colors, telling stories and jokes.  And  it it (stutter) just flies by, he's so good.  I wish comedians today were as good as Bill Cosby, but they probably never will be.  (umm)  Also it's a very family friendly piece, if you know if you have kids you can watch this with your kids.  (umm) You know where you probably wouldn't watch Chris Rock  with your kids.  You could, but who knows what will happen to them.  Imagine they'll be fine.  (umm) But they'll be extra fine with Bill Cosby because this is a great little piece.  And (uhh) the dvd itself is just a single disc in the old style with no label.  And the picture of him with a hat going.  And  no special features really, there are two versions of the (uhh)  of the show. One in full screen and one in widescreen.  And that's about it as far as special features go. But it is just a standup dvd you can usually pick it up cheap,  and (uhh)  I say get it.  Get it, you'll enjoy it, pop it in every once in a while and it's always a guaranteed laugh.  For Theo and the pudding for Rudy.	5.354
This is a review of John Lamaro's Land of the Dead.   Land of the Dead was (umm)   and not as good   as (uhh)   the other Romero zombie movies.   (umm)   Yes it continued the motif of having   zombies represent either   (uhh) some sort of disenfranchised group. (umm)   Which was you know, and important and interesting   but if you like   overall it really is, wasn't that new of a plot going on here.   (umm) Felt pretty rehashed.   As for the acting, the acting was pretty good (uhh) John Leguizamo was okay,   better than I expected and (umm)  Dennis Hopper was awesome as always. (umm)  so I'd give this film a  two out of five.	2.944
This is a review for a movie currently in theaters called License to Wed, starring Robin Williams, John Krasinski and Mandy Moore. It's about a young couple who are getting ready to wed but before they are allowed to do so in the church (uhh) the priest, played by Robin Williams, requires that they go through his (uhh) training classes for (uhh) to make sure they're ready for marriage.   (umm)   I primarily went to this movie because I'm a big fan of The Office and I like   (uhh) John Krasinski's work on on (stutter) that show. I'm not a big fan of Robin Williams at all. I find him (uhh)  pretty annoying to be honest. So I was hoping that (uhh) John Krasinski would balance out my dislike for Robin Williams and (uhh)  Mandy Moore's an attractive lady so that was a plus. I'm no you know fan of her acting or anything so I was kind of indifferent towards her. But the movie itself was alright. It had a couple of funny scenes and a couple of funny lines but it wasn't  it wasn't really worth going to.  I didn't (uhh) Robin Williams was grating as usual. So if you're not a big Robin Williams fan (umm) and the preview hasn't appealed to you I would suggest (uhh) waiting until it comes out on DVD at least to see this movie.	4.082
Hey guys, this is Napoleon Dynamite. This is probably one of the funniest movies (uhh) when it came out. A lot of people (uhh)  weren't too sure, or a little cautious about seeing this movie. But after it (uhh)  started playing in theaters it it (stutter) boomed really. (umm)  Anywhere you look you've heard of this movie because it's so good. And (uhh)  you've seen, you know, (umm) action figures, you've seen posters, you've seen everything.  I think this movie's hilarious. (uhh) After a while it gets a little old like with them having  (uhh) having a lot of products and stuff now that deal with Napoleon Dynamite it does get a little old and with people quoting it all the time. That gets a little old, especially if they can't quote it correctly. But (umm)  if you've never seen this movie I suggest that you watch it because it is hilarious. (uhh) I've probably seen it maybe five or six times and I still like it a lot. It's rated PG so (uhh) your kids can watch it and I'm sure they'll love it. They'll think it's really funny.   And (uhh) I like it so much that I even have a poster on it.  That's Kip  from Napoleon Dynamite and that's (uhh) Napoleon Dynamites older brother. (uhh)  This movie, you probably know, stars John Heder. John Heder also does   Benchwarmers, (umm)   he's starred on Saturday Night Live,   he's done  a whole bunch of other funny movies that I can't actually recall right now but  he's he's (stutter) a funny guy, this is probably his first film that he ever (stutter) directed and made, but it won, it won (stutter) an award at the Sundance Film Festival.  (umm) There have been other good movies that have done that too like Little Miss Sunshine so (uhh)   if you like that movie and you know that it won that award then (uhh) you should watch Napoleon Dynamite. Hilarious movie, funny. Only bad thing is that it (uhh) has gotten a little old and (uhh) can sometimes be annoying.	4.082
(uhh) I'm doing the review of Live Free or Die Hard, currently in theaters starring Bruce Willis and (umm)  the guy from the Mac commercials, (uhh) Justin Long.  (umm) This movie is pretty good, has a lot of action (uhh) high intense (uhh) (stutter) scenes. I really like this film. (umm)  I'd say it's better than the last (uhh) Die hard movie.  (umm) There's some great lines with (stutter) Bruce Willis (stutter) as always.   (umm)  I like the (uhh) the special effects they had (uhh) the action. I like the how they used the jet in the one particular scene. I don't want to give it away, but it's pretty awesome.   (umm)  The Justin Long plays a hacker, which (uhh) he's (uhh) hunted down by secret (uhh)  hacking group trying to kill him.  (umm) They're trying to kill all the hackers in the world to take over the United States and Bruce Willis has to track this guy down   (uhh) Justin Long's character, and he finally does   take him to get away from the terrorist and so.  (uhh) In the end I like the movie I suggest you go out and see it now.	6.403
Hi my name's Tommy and today I'm going to be talking to you about,  Detroit Rock City Kiss the Rules Goodbye  (uhh) This is a DVD,   and it's definitely a good one.   (umm) It's about four kids who try and go to a rock concert,   a Kiss concert in Detroit.   (umm) In it, it has Edward (stutter) Furlong, who starred in American History X,   Natasha Lyonne,   (uhh) Lin Shaye, Sam Huntington,   and of course Kiss.   Now the kids get into a bunch of trouble.  They go through a lot of different situations  (umm) in order to get to the Kiss concert.  (umm) See the movie's about ninety-one minutes long.  (uhh) One of the guys actually ends up stripping  in a amateur stripping contest.  There's no nudity throughout the movie.  (umm) Partial at most, but nothing that  you wouldn't want your kids to see or anything like that.  (umm) All in all I'd give this movie about four out of five.  And that's Kiss Detroit Rock City Kiss the Rules Goodbye.	4.082
This review is for a film currently in theaters called   Hot Fuzz. (umm)   It's by the same people who made   Sean of the Dead.   And I never saw Sean of the Dead,   so I really didn't know what to expect. (umm)   I had a lot of people tell me it was really funny (umm)   but not in a traditional sense you just had to go see it you know,  it's funny I can't explain it but you have to go see it. (umm)  So I did and it was  (umm) really hilarious. (uhh) There's  a lot of moments in it where you just can't help it to laugh out loud, to like belly laugh because it's so funny or  (uhh) or clap because it's (umm)  so great, so  it's it's (stutter) rare for a movie like that to come along. It's also really original too, (umm)   it's not like stupid slapstick comedy it's really smart, it's really inventive   (umm) and you don't really see it coming either. (umm)   The acting in it is really great too.   I I (stutter) didn't recognize most of the people in it they're all British actors (umm)   but it was really amazing and I really enjoyed it and   I can't wait for like, the next Sean of the Dead or Hot Fuzz movie to come out cuz I'm definitely gonna go see it. (umm)   So yeah, that's Hot Fuzz, it's really great, it's really funny.   Definitely get to the theater and check it out.	5.0
Alright this review is for Dead or Alive, the movie  (umm) based off the video game.  (umm) It's  kind of like a,  it's halfway of a parody, halfway serious movie.  (umm) It doesn't it doesn't (stutter) try to be too serious but it also isn't a comedy or anything like that.  (umm) It's a martial arts movie.  (umm) Type of movie that basically stars  (umm) four four four (stutter) of the people from the game.  (umm) and they  it's basically just an excuse to have martial arts and CG in a movie.  (umm) Basically they just screw around  (uhh) go around beating people up, getting in fights  (umm) showing off, doing the ninja thing and then  (uhh) there's a little bit of a plot thrown in. But it's not  nothing believable. Not even very easy to follow.  (umm) Yeah there's a lot of holes in the plot.  (umm) Overall, I'd say it's probably not worth it to see this movie.  (umm) I I (stutter) Yeah this is one of those movies where definitely video games should not be made in the   (uhh) movies. Too hard to follow. Not they don't make great movies, not enough plot in them.  (umm) So yeah, and the acting, overall, not very great.  (umm) The fight scenes were all right. They're semi decent, but still  (umm) nothing, nothing (stutter) good. (stutter) I probably wouldn't even rent this movie. Don't even bother.	3.873
Hi Expo TV. I'm going to be reviewing the Garfield: Holiday Celebrations DVD and if you like the Garfield show you'll definitely enjoy this DVD set, which includes the Garfield episodes for his Halloween adventure, Thanksgiving and Christmas.  And what I really liked about this, is that it it (stutter) includes the Halloween episode and   as far as I know the Halloween episode is absolutely impossible to find and this DVD is really the only way to get it.  (umm) The Halloween adventure is hilarious and amusing as well as the  Thanksgiving and Christmas episode, (umm) especially with how much Garfield loves to eat.  (umm) I really enjoyed it. It's very festive.  (umm) It will really get you in the mood for you know, whatever holiday you're looking for, either Halloween, or Thanksgiving or Christmas.  And I definitely recommend the Garfield: Holiday Celebrations DVD.	4.435
Okay. This is Donnie Darko.  It's (umm) definitely a cult movie favorite.  (uhh) It's, out of five stars, I would give it a five.  (umm) It follows this boy Donnie Darko, played by  (uhh) Jake Gyllenhaal.  And   He's   he's a very weird kid.  (umm) He sees this  this (stutter) like demented bunny who tells him when the world is going to end and Donnie just has to figure everything out.  (umm) It's definitely dark.  (uhh) Not recommended for kids at all.   (umm) I really like how it's done because, if you watch this movie five times you will still not understand everything about it.  (umm) There's just so much things. It it (stutter) involves like, (uhh) theoretical physics and  just so much stuff and  Donnie Darko no matter how weird he is is still really funny. (uhh) He's a highly intelligent kid who's friends aren't so intelligent and  he can just  talk for about anything, he just does it really well.	4.082
Hello Expo TV. Today I have another great movie for only in theater review for you and that is Nancy Drew.  Nancy Drew, to be honest, I really didn't like at all. (umm) I took my younger brother and sister to go see it and they loved it so I guess it's more of a preteen  (uhh) adolescent kid movie than for (umm)  young adults and adults. (umm) I would say if you're babysitting and you wanna get the kids, they wanna see a movie xxx like that, Nancy Drew (umm) would be good for that. (umm) It's basically like the Nancy Drew books. The girl she's a detective and (umm) and she's really good. (umm)  And  I mean she's solving mysteries. She's a little bit of an oddball. She doesn't really fit in (umm)  with the current times, the current kids. Which is kind of interesting. I though (umm) they kind of set her out as sort of like the books are Nancy Drew. (umm) She was kind of old fashioned and all the way she dressed and she is very conservative and compared to the newer kids and I thought that was an interesting contrast which the younger kids I don't think would pick up on. But (umm)  really I mean you have as much depth as a kids movie has and I mean, it's basically you know a kid's spy series. So, I mean for younger kids I think it's great but for older audiences, I mean again it's a good family movie but (umm) definitely not a blockbuster hit. (uhh) Once again, Nancy Drew.	3.873
The movie Elf is probably the best Christmas movie  I've ever seen. (uhh) Will (stutter) I was a little skeptical of Will Ferrell I thought this was gonna really (uhh) be a vulgar Christmas comedy  but it got the, it got the (stutter) PG rating  and this movie is absolutely hilarious. This is the kind of movie that I've watched over and over again and laughed every time.  Very quotable.  (umm) The story's of Buddy the elf  who basically  ends up in the North Pole  and is adopted by the elves  but he grows really tall and they real and some one day they finally tell him that he's actually not an elf.  And so he has to go seek out his real father  who is a regular scrooge.  And (umm) the rest of the movie is about how he (stutter) teaches his real dad and everybody else the true meaning of Christmas.  (umm) The plotline is classic Will Ferrell  and the comedy is some of his best,  definitely a must have for  a Christmas movie.	4.082
I'm here to review this movie, called Johnny Mnemonic.  And it stars Keanu Reeves. And (uhh) it's rated R. And there's, you know, bad language and (uhh) some violence scenes. And it's it's (stutter) a futuristic movie, but (uhh)  it's interesting in a way, if you (uhh) are into the future kind of thing and technology and (uhh) this is kind of like how technology takes over and how people live and and (stutter) work and (uhh) a (uhh) story about (uhh) one guy. He's (umm)  like a courier. And (uhh)  he delivers messages that are inputted into his brain. And (uhh) some problems that he comes up with when he's overloaded. But it's a, it's a (stutter) interesting kind of story if you like technical (uhh) stuff and everything. And, like I said, it's futuristic. But this movie's been out for a while. And (uhh) so your prices will probably be, you know, fifteen or maybe, you know, a lot less than that. So, but it's interesting. I enjoyed it. So I hope you'll try it and I hope you enjoy it.	3.559
(uhh) Hi expotv, my name is Landon and I'm here to talk to you about the Donnie Darko DVD, the director's cut.  This is a movie about a kid named Donnie who's (uhh) going through some problems, he has some bad dreams, sees some stuff that he's not really supposed to be seeing and (uhh)  his parents pay for him to see a psychiatrist but he's kind of young and (uhh)  (stutter) when you're young you don't think that's such a cool idea to see a psychiatrist, you think you're kind of a freak, and really he's just a normal kid, he's just kind of got a problem. And (uhh) but this kind of goes through some of his dreams and  kind of somewhat of just like a teenage life, like what kids go through and  it's just put together really cool and done really well. Also the soundtrack is amazing to this.  (uhh) I give this DVD a five star rating just because the music that goes along with it and how realistic it is, like,  it was just done very well and it's a really good movie.  So if you don't have anything to do and you're looking for a good movie, Donnie Darko is a great movie and you should check it out. Alright, thank you.	3.367
Hi. This is Mama Three for expotv. Today I'd like to review the movie Aladdin on Disney DVD.  This movie was originally released in nineteen-ninety-two, it's rated G, and it's approximately ninety minutes long.  This is the story of a boy named Aladdin who really lives just on the streets, and a princess named Jasmine who doesn't like the laws that have been set forth by the kingdom for a princess.   She wants more than what's in the castle, she wants to go out and experience things, and in that process she meets Aladdin. He knows that she can never be with him because she is has to marry a prince and he's not one. In the process he finds a lamp and inside is a genie. The genie cannot make  her fall in love with him, but he can however turn Aladdin into a prince and that is what he does.  Along with this nobody knows that the king's  closest advisor, named Jafar,  is trying to get power of the kingdom from the king.  He ends up getting ahold of the  lamp and you can just imagine what happens with that. This movie does have some scary scenes in it. At the end when Jafar turns into a snake if your child is afraid of snakes in any way I would fast forward that part of the movie or possibly  this one isn't the one for them. Some of the neatest thing in this is the animation. Robin Williams voices the genie.  Robin Williams, I'm sorry, voices the genie, and they really got his facial characteristics. You can see him actually doing the things that the genie does and there's actually one part during one of the songs where (stutter) does Robin Williams impersonations of several of the characters that he does and they make the genie turn into those characters and I just think they did a really good  job with this animation. It's an entertaining film  and I think it's one that most children will enjoy. It did win  two Oscars, one for original score and one for (umm) best (stutter) original song with A Whole New World.  (stutter) One of the other voices that you might hear in the movie is of Gilbert Gottfried. He plays the parrot Iago and that's one of those things where you hear it and you  think that you might know what what (stutter) it is, so that's the other famous voice in the movie. But this is a good movie for kids.  I would recommend it.	4.203
Today I'm doing a review for Weekend at Bernie's Two. (umm) I really liked the original Weekend at Bernie's so I thought I would like this one.  Basically after the first movie ends and they spend their weekend with Bernie (umm)  these two guys  (uhh) go to their bank and find out they're fired (umm) and they also find out that Bernie, when he was alive, had stolen two million dollars and it's in the Virgin Islands. So they have to go back to the Virgin Islands and,  and find the money. (umm) This is the movie playing in the background. (umm)  It's it's (stutter) just not as funny as the first one, I like,  I liked the first one a lot better. In this movie there's this,  you know, in the Virgin Islands there's this  lady who brings them back to life and,  I don't know, I just thought that was kind of lame. So (umm) if you're a fan of the original I don't think you'd like this one but  once again this is Weekend at Bernie's Two.	4.435
Hello expo my name is Jocelyn.  I have to tell you about a movie that was fantastic.  It's Ratatouille and it was really a great animated movie.  This movie is so good because it's  very real.  The reason it's real is because the animators  were actually asked to go to France and film  everything culinary,  just the way it would be cooked  so that it could be reproduced in this  movie.  That is what is one of the things that makes it so great.  Remy is played by Patton Oswalt and he does a fantastic job  of you can even see the expressions of Remy,  but and that's quite odd, even when he's running or when he's thinking about what he's cooking.  That really translates so there has to be some great animators to do that.  One prepares the food, it's just as it is, was (stutter) or is to be prepared,  the way that the culinary chefs do to prepare food.  He wants to be a chef although and, since he's a rat that sort of holds him back because society frowns on that.  His family is appalled because he, he (stutter) wants to be a chef because they can't seem  to figure out why he just doesn't want to sniff garbage.  So as they would have it, he ends up in a store in France, and from there there's some hilarious wonderful authentic  and funny, funny  stuff that is just so right on with  food network and the way cooking should be.  It's just a wonderful movie for all ages,  so if you want to see something that's very entertaining with a lot of laughs and even get educated about how to cook,  with a (uhh) profession such as a  gourmet chef from France,  you'll love  Remy. (stutter) (uhh) Ratatouille give it a try.	5.802
Tonight I want to review the DVD called Presumed Innocent, put out by Warner Brothers and it's rated R for (umm) sexual content. Not a lot of language, but it's a lot of adult scenes in here.  It stars Harrison Ford, Raul Julia before he passed away. I don't know if this is one of his last movies but (uhh) this is a very good movie.  (umm) Harrison Ford is a  (umm) deputy prosecutor or I forget what you call em, a  (umm)  he plays  (umm) a defense lawyer I guess. (umm) But he plays this lawyer   and he he (stutter) is having an affair with his coworker and it goes on for quite a while and nobody knows anything about, til one day, she's murdered.  Then of course, (uhh) Raul Julia, the policeman accuses Harrison Ford of (uhh) being the killer because  he found out about the affair and of course he just figured that he had motive.  So the movie's about Harrison Ford  (uhh) defending himself  (uhh) from these charges of murder and  (umm) to keep himself out of prison.  (umm) It's a very good movie.  (umm) It's it's (stutter) like a real sexy who done it.  And (umm) it's a good movie I enjoy it and the ending will surprise you. But it's called Presumed Innocent and it's (uhh) starring Harrison Ford and it's still available for ten dollars.	5.0
This review is for the movie Three Hundred,  a Warner Brother picture.  (uhh) This movie actually was made from (uhh) a cartoon series of a book.  (uhh) It was originally in in (stutter) cartoon form. (uhh) And when they made the movie, the look of the movie is is (stutter) pretty interesting cuz they they (stutter) kind of made it to look kind of, I believe kind of along the lines of a of a (stutter)  animated cartoon.  (uhh) The way they did that was this whole movie was shot in a studio behind a green screen.  And what that is, is basically there's a big green screen behind the actors and then later they take out that green screen and put in the (umm) whatever they want, the (umm)   the landscape or whatever.  (umm) So basically it's an all digital movie. They did a lot of the effects digitally  and (uhh) this is a really great movie, I really like it.  (uhh) There's a lot of action in it.  (uhh) What it focuses around is (uhh) Spartans, the three hundred Spartans that held off the Persian army.  (uhh) and the king here on the cover  that (uhh) leads them and basically it's like a suicide mission  but he wants to do it so he can give all the other Spartans and all the other Romans hope  so they can defeat this this (stutter) huge Persian army that's coming.  And (umm) It's just, it's it's (stutter) a really good story,  the action in it is just just (stutter) unbelievable.  (umm) What's really cool about it is some of the things like you'll see a guy jumping in the air with a sword and then he'll stop in the air for a couple seconds  and then they'll go slow motion.  You know really cool effects.  (umm) So if you like action movies and you like kind of time period pieces, or fantasy pieces I would guess,  (uhh) this would be a really great movie if you haven't seen it.  (uhh) It has some weird like mythological creatures in it.  (umm) Just a good story, and (uhh) basically in a nutshell real quick the story is  where (uhh) the king of Persia  he comes, he sends some (umm)  (uhh) people into (umm)  Rome basically to tell them to give up because he's coming and he wants to take over the land.  And he sends these two attaches to Sparta  which is this king's (uhh) territory,  and they basically drop some heads of other kings that they they've (stutter) conquered, at you know this guy's feet and tell him to (uhh) give up or he's gonna  have the same fate.  And this guy's a real  bad mother effer.  And he basically kicks the guy into this big pit  that is endless pit or whatever.  And the battle's on. (umm)  And like I said the fight scenes are incredible.  (uhh) I'm not gonna tell you the ending, the ending is really, really cool in my opinion.  (umm) And the the (stutter) story follows  the the (stutter) king, it shows a little bit when he was a kid how he was trained and how he how he (stutter) was brought up  (uhh) in the Sparta lifestyle.  And how he became king and also his wife which is the queen, it shows her how  she (umm)  kind of (uhh) thwarts some treachery that's going on also  (umm) to try to kind of overtake her husband and and (stutter) spread bad  bad views and ill will about him,   and she actually stands up and and (stutter) does a good job of of (stutter)  you know (umm) being a man {laugh} I guess. But anyway this is a really great movie, it's made by Warner Brothers,  (uhh) it's it's (stutter) original in the sense that the way it was filmed and the look of it, it's kind of a washed out color look.  (uhh) If you haven't seen it I would definitely recommend it (uhh) Three Hundred.	4.967
Hello, my name is Sarah, and I will be doing the video review for the movie Josie and the Pussycats.  (uhh) Basically, I really did not like this movie at all.  (umm) I felt it was kinda cheesy.  (umm) Of course I had low expectations at that, and hose expectations weren't even met. So you know, to recommend this movie, you know I really wouldn't.  (umm) I, I (stutter) found one thing about this movie that I thought was kind of interesting how  (umm) these record companies put (uhh) subliminal messages in music to push products to get people to buy certain things.  (umm) That part of the movie was pretty cool, but  (umm) for the most part you know, it was, again it was too cheesy for me. You know  (umm) it was actually expected to be kind of corny. So I really wouldn't recommend this, this (stutter) movie to anybody.  (umm) No, I mean, basically the movie was just you know,  trying to put you know,  just. I just again, really just did not like this movie. I don't recommend it for people and   the actors on this movie, they didn't really do a good job either. It was you know, kind of expected as well. These you know, girls that played in this movie just  they didn't really do a good job. So, I really not at all recommend this movie to anybody.	5.0
Hey guys, today I'm reviewing the movie Born to Fight.  Critics say this movie is breathtaking, and insanely entertaining.  Which is true.  (umm) This comes with two disks and it is,  called the two disc ultimate edition.  (uhh) There's lot's of special features like the making of it.  And, this movie is not rated,  and it is approximately ninety-six minutes long.  (uhh) There's really a lot of action in this movie. It's really good.  (umm) I definitely recommend it.  (umm) If you're fans of like, Jackie Chan movies, or the Protector, or xxx definitely watch this.  It's a lot of Kung-Fu.  (umm) Yeah, just a lot of action, a lot of explosions,  (umm) just a lot of insane bone-breaking sweet footage.  (umm) Yeah definitely check this out. I got this at Walmart.  (umm) You can get it at Target, Best Buy, Circuit City. Pretty much anywhere that  sells movies.  And yeah, I definitely recommend this movie. Thanks	4.509
Expotv I'd like to review a documentary which I recently saw called Quantum Hoops.  I'd say this is a very good movie, I'm really into sports movies and I like sports in general so this sounded interesting to me.  Basically it's the story of Cal Tech which is  not really the most athletic school, they're more kind of book smart, and it's the story of their basketball team  and really the whole thing is that they're just trying to win.  All they want to win is one game. I believe it was that they hadn't won a game in like over two-hundred  (uhh) league games so they really had their work cut out for them. The movie stars most of the basketball players themselves I believe, so the acting can kind of be as followed. I mean, it's not really all acting cause it is a documentary, but  it's definitely a good movie, something to check out if your theater has it. It's Quantum Hoops, it's about basketball,  it's about Cal Tech,  and it's about time that you saw this movie. Highly recommended, five out of five from me. You heard it first.	5.354
Hello, my name is Sara and I will be doing my video opinion on the classic Elf,  (umm) starring the wonderful comedian Will Ferrell.  (uhh) This movie's basically about a child who was found in a convent and snuck into Santa Claus's bag, was taken back to the North Pole  and had (uhh) been raised by elves.  So basically he lived his whole life  you know  (umm) thinking he was an elf. Of course he was the tallest kid. Like he couldn't fit in the seats, you know he always outgrew all the other elves so he always had wondered you know, why was he so different.  So he finds out that he  (umm) has a dad somewhere else  (uhh) and he travels to New York City.  (umm) This movie is is (stutter) definitely hilarious.  (umm) It goes through the you know, different things that he had experienced being in New York.  (umm) Experiencing you know, a whole new life change.  (umm) Which I thought was you know, really cool. He's going through all these different things. He decides to work at a toy store.  (umm) This is just really cool and this, what I like about this DVD is that it gives you an option. It gives you two discs,  (umm) which one is for widescreen and one is for full screen. Which is great I think  (umm) you know, someone who really doesn't, I don't really like widescreen so I'm great that it gives me an option. So  again I really think you should pick it up. This movie is hilarious and  (umm) it's definitely  (umm) watchable for any child and any adult.	6.683
Hi, it's Jason and I'll be doing a review on the movie  Delta Farce coming right up.  Thank you.  Hi it's Jason and I'll continue my review on Delta Farce. (umm) Basically it's a (stutter) comedy that stars three different people,  it stars Larry the Cable Guy and Bill Envall and D.J. (stutter) Qualls.  (umm) Basically they are (umm) some army, they are mistaken to being army reserve troops.  And they're (stutter) hussled away to  what they thought was Iraq but what end up happening is they drop them off in Mexico instead and they try to liberate Mexico.  (umm) This is by (umm)  the blue collar comedy tour director Stevy Harry and (stutter) as some of you may know from the,   the (umm) touring   for the blue collar comedy tour.   (umm) If you like these three people you might like this movie. I found this movie absolutely  dumb. It just, it just (stutter) wasn't good nothing worked.  (umm) These aren't my three favorite comedians.  (umm) The movie's rated PG-thirteen.  (umm) It's eighty minutes eighty-nine (stutter) minutes long and it was it was (stutter) (umm) filmed in two thousand seven it was completed and released, so  that tells you a lot about how, how (stutter) good this movies I remember when it came out at the movie theaters it wasn't  a hit at all.  (umm) And also costars Danny Trejo,  (umm) but that's about it I mean I don't wanna give away too much but I had a hard time sitting through this. I (stutter) just,  I didn't find it funny I actually found it really stupid and as you can see in the background it's just a menu with some small clips from the movie.  (umm) But if you're thinking about buying this movie I probably think twice again.  So again this is for Delta Farce.  Thank you.	5.745
Hi guys it is coach Jim again.  I talk to you about another movie I recently watched  with my son.  It was (uhh) Fred Claus.  Now Fred Claus is  a show.  Well if you've seen the previews you've seen the best parts of the movie.  (umm)  It wasn't my favorite,  I actually thought the plot stunk.  The acting  was horrible.  (umm)  It's not one of my favorites that I've I've (stutter) watched, it was actually one of the worst ones I've seen in a long time.  (umm)  Just,  it (stutter) oh my gosh it's so  (stutter) my eleven year old son did,  about halfway through he was ready to go home.  Okay, oh me, we've seen this plot millions and millions of times,  you know blah blah blah, everybody knows  you can pretty much tell what the whole movie's about just from the commercials.  (umm)  Not my favorite show  and I do not recommend it for anybody it was just retarded.  (umm)  It has,  it it (stutter) makes no sense it kind of shift around a little bit. (umm)  Thank you.	5.447
Hi Expo TV. This is Rachel. Today I'm going to be reviewing the movie Crossroads.  If you think Britney Spears is bad now  you haven't seen this movie. It's awful. It's about three girls in high school.  (umm) they're getting ready to graduate and go their separate ways. They were best friends when they were younger  and now they've gone their separate ways and they've come back together and they're going on a road trip.  (umm) Awful awful acting. Obviously starring Britney Spears,  (umm) Taryn Manning and  Zoe Saldana. Also has Dan Akroyd and Kim Catrell in it.  (umm) It does have a lot of special features, if you like Britney Spears it's got some music videos.  (umm) Two of em, for "Overprotective" and "I'm Not A Girl, I'm Not Yet A Woman".  (umm) Seven deleted scenes, a sing along with Britney, a karaoke version of some of her songs.  (umm) A Crossroads through photo gallery. Lots of special features but an awful movie. I give it two out of five stars.	5.26
Hi. I'm Liz and I'm here to talk to you about The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, based on the beloved series of books by Douglas Adams, may he rest in peace.  (umm) I'm not entirely convinced that the people who made this movie understood the books at all. (umm) Part of, I think, that the remarkable thing about the books is Douglas Adams wrote them sequentially, with no planning ahead of time as to what was gonna to happen. And yet, they all come around into an incredibly tight plot and theme.  (uhh) That's part of what makes them so amazing. And this movie destroys all of that by sort of creating its own (umm) self-contained plot because I guess they weren't planning on making more movies. They're certainly not going to now, I don't think. (umm) Since no one really liked it that much.  (umm) They just {sigh} it's hard to explain if you're not a Douglas Adams fan. You haven't, you know, read all the books and seen the movie. To really feel what it was they got wrong, there's just a feeling missing. Everything that he intended and all these sort of (umm) jokes that he meant to be funny in a particular way just aren't the same, and they've added a lot of their own jokes that are funny in a very different way, not not (stutter) what he would have wanted.  (umm) It's not a great adaptation. Is it a good movie? I suppose it's kind of amusing in its own way, but it's not a good adaptation of the story. And I think the greatest example of that is the line at the very end, when Alan Rickman as the robot says, they're (stutter) heading to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, which is the name of the second, the second (stutter) novel in the series, and is an actual setting in the novel. And he says, not that anyone cares, or asked me, or whatever, but the restaurant is at the other end of the universe.  The restaurant was not, even if you casually read Douglas Adams, you know the restaurant is not at the physical end of the universe, it's at the temporal end of the universe. It's a place where you can go, utilizing time travel, you can go to this particular point in time, at just the point the universe ends, and watch it end. And that's sort of the main attraction of the restaurant. It's like their evening show.  That's just a really, really obvious, stupid mistake. Why did they have to make that joke? It's not that good. Considering it got something so completely wrong, I think Douglas Adams fans would just grit their teeth.  (umm) And that's the kind of thing they do in this movie. And I think that makes it kind of painful. (umm) The only up side is the special effects are fantastic. The previous adaptation of Hitchhiker was done by the BBC on a shoestring budget. It looks awful. It's great, but it looks terrible. This movie is terrible, and looks great.  So, you know, whatever you want to sacrifice, I guess, but, (uhh) no, this movie doesn't capture the spirit of the story at all. So I don't recommend it, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.	6.055
Hi. Today on ExpoTV I'm going to be reviewing the movie Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium. And Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium is (umm) a movie that's in theaters now and it stars (umm) Jason Bateman and (uhh) Natalie Portman and Dustin Hoffman. And (umm) basically it's about (umm) this guy, Dustin Hoffman, named Mr. Magorium. And he has this huge magic shop. And there's, like, tons of stuff going on.  And (umm) he, he (stutter) says (umm) it's time for him to leave, which kind of implies, like, he's going to die. And (umm) so he leaves, he's going to leave the store to (umm) Natalie Portman's character to, you know, run and keep it going. And (umm) also, this other guy is going to help (umm) do the bills, the character who is (umm) played by (uhh) Jason Bateman. And (umm) this guy is really, like, drab and doesn't believe in the magic of the store and (umm) is just generally a jerk. And (umm) the movie kind of goes, follows (umm) the decisions and how they affect (umm) those two characters in relation to, like, who owns the store and (umm) how the store handles (umm) each one of those characters.  So it's really a fantastical, fantasy-like movie and (umm) it's not really that good. (umm) The story is kind of blur and drab and it's just so so. So I don't really recommend it. I give it, like, two stars. It's not very good. (umm) Even though there's a lot of, like, famous good actors and actresses (umm) it still doesn't make up for just the bad story. So (umm) yeah, don't see it. It's not that good.	2.0
Hello.   Today I will be reviewing  My Big Fat Greek Wedding.  (umm) Which was written by and stars Nia Vardalos as  a thirty something (uhh)  Greek woman who  (uhh) still lives with her parents and (uhh) they want her to  (uhh) find a nice husband.  (uhh) Who is Greek, and start having a bunch of Greek babies.  (uhh)  She feels (uhh) pressured from this so she (uhh)  and she also wants to get out from under their rule.  (uhh) (uhh) And enrolls in college  (uhh) to become a travel agent.  And meets a very nice man  and falls in love with him and brings him home to her parents.  (uhh) They find out he's not Greek and then  (uhh) they're,  (uhh) it just shows they're  trying to accept this.  (uhh) The boyfriend  is played by (uhh)  (umm)  Josh Corbett (uhh) who you might remember from Sex In the City  and Northern Exposure.  And (uhh)  overall I found the movie to be okay. (uhh) It wasn't great as everybody said it,  (uhh) everybody told me was,  but I thought that it had its entertaining moments.  And (uhh)  (uhh) one of my  favorite parts of it was (uhh)  one of her (stutter) one of (uhh) the main character's cousins  was played by Joey Fatone and he was (stutter) from NSYNC and he was just (uhh)  really crazy along with her brother.  (uhh) Again that's (uhh)  My Big Fat Greek Wedding on DVD.	4.359
Hi ExpoTV, I'm here today to talk to you about the DVD movie  Jackass The Movie.  (umm) The only part that I could find to play for you was the opening credits because everything else is insanely crude and  terrible. And this is the least offensive part that I could find to play.  (uhh) So that should tell you something about the movie. This movie is not for children, it is rated R, R, R. Should be rated more if there's rating more than that.  (umm) It has a (uhh) restriction on it, it says (uhh)  that it is rated R for dangerous sometimes extremely crude stunts, language and nudity, and that is an understatement.  (umm) It is raunchy at its best and lots of people getting hurt and doing  insane things that you and I would probably never imagine to do, but these guys did.  (umm) So if you like that kind of stuff, (uhh) go out and get this movie,  (uhh) it is again Jackass The Movie on DVD, and it's rated R for your entertainment.  So go out and get this movie and I hope you find this review helpful.	4.83
Hey. I am going to review a movie. (uhh) I am going to be reviewing the movie The Wall.  (umm) This is a musical movie. It's by Pink Floyd and I am sure you have heard of the CD, The Wall.  (umm) This is the movie that was made I think a couple years after the CD or the album actually came out.  (umm) This is a story about a man named Pink who is a rock star and  he is sitting in an hotel room and sort of just kind of reflecting on his life and (uhh) what he has been through and  slowly going mad basically (umm) he's you know kind of reflecting on how his father died in the war and the school (umm) system that he was raised in very strictly and (umm) his wife actually has an affair and that's sort of the last straw and he decides to  (umm) kind of run off and just slowly go mad I guess you could say and the reason it's called the wall because he, all these things that happen to him have been  sort of a brick in the wall and he has building a wall around him and now he has completely closed himself off from anybody and (umm)  and just goes crazy so (umm) it's definitely a good movie, (uhh) if you like Pink Floyd of course you would love this movie. I I (stutter) just love this movie. (umm) I am a big Pink Floyd fan so (umm) I really do like this one and (umm) even if you are not a Pink Floyd fan if you're interested in you know,  sort of the mind and how it works  (umm) you might be interested in this movie, (umm) it is rated R because there is (stutter) some violence and some nudity and probably I believe some language  as well in the movie (umm) so not for kids but (umm) it is a good movie so if you're curious about it definitely go (umm) check it out.  Thanks.	5.686
Hello everyone. Playing over my shoulder here is Alien Resurrection, (uhh) and it's a pretty stupid movie. (uhh) The first Alien is a good movie. (uhh) Aliens is a very good movie. Alien three is not so good of a movie, and this is the worst of the four (uhh) in my opinion. (uhh) Sigourney Weaver, who died at the end of Alien three, is (uhh) genetically (uhh) brought back to life so she can star in another sequel that (uhh) tries very, very hard to be funny and just ends up being not funny at all. (umm) It has really good cinematography and a really good visual style the guy who directed it (umm), Jean-Pierre Jeunet, I'm not sure if I pronounced his name properly, I don't speak French, so pardon me, (umm) he also directed (umm) City of Lost Children and Delicatessen and (uhh) Amelie, (uhh) which is a pretty good movie. He directed this and I don't think he spoke English when he directed this, otherwise he may, might might (stutter) have have noticed how terrible a lot of the dialogue in this movie is. (umm)  It was written by (umm) Joss Whedon, that's right. He (uhh) wrote, I think, some episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I don't know. I really didn't care for this movie. (uhh) It doesn't add anything new to the franchise. (umm) Some of the actors are okay. (umm) Weaver does her best with what she's given, and (uhh) but it really doesn't amount to much in my opinion. (umm) As far as (umm) special features go on this disc, (uhh) the only thing that's on here is (umm) some interviews with the cast and crew, so if you, you know, are looking for some special features, this is not the edition to go for. (umm) I really don't like this movie. Don't buy it.	5.745
Hi, I'm Thomas, and I'm going to be talking you about the movie Fourteen-Oh-Eight. (uhh) Fourteen-Oh-Eight is based on the Stephen King novel (umm) and it features Samuel L Jackson and John Cusack. And the movie was about a writer that's exploring a room in a hotel that supposedly has paranormal events going on in it. And I must say this is one of the most terrifying movies I've ever seen because there is just so much suspense built up, it's not even a matter of actually  seeing something scary but the suspense just builds for,  for hours. It's a pretty long movie. (umm)  I felt like it dragged on a little bit in the end for a fairly disappointing ending, but {clears throat}  but it is a very scary movie. (umm) The visual effects are great, everything looks really good, and  there are a lot of good performances although John Cusack is the main one since he's  the majority of the movie. (umm) And I'd recommend it for like a date night or something like that just because it's so scary.	4.359
Expotv, how you doing? Nick B here. Today I'm going to be reviewing the DVD The Silence of the Lambs with Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, and Scott Glenn.  This is the (uhh) special edition DVD here that I am reviewing tonight. It is (uhh)  a great movie. It, it (stutter) won an Oscar  for best picture in nineteen-ninety-one. It is rated R, it's a very disturbing movie, not anything you want to let your kids see. I saw this when I was a kid, it gave me bad dreams for weeks. So definitely, definitely keep this for the grownups. (uhh) The approximate run time on here is an hour and fifty-eight minutes and like I said it came out in nineteen-ninety-one. The DVD is in color. We have some great special features here on it. We have a brand new inside the labyrinth documentary including all the interviews with the cast, featuring Anthony Hopkins, Jodie Foster, and more. We also have twenty minutes worth of deleted scenes, that's a lot of extra footage there for you to watch. We have the original making of from nineteen-ninety-one, we have Anthony Hopkins phone message, we have a never before seen outtake reel, we have a photo gallery, collectible booklet that comes with this DVD. I keep mine right here inside the DVD, I don't want to lose my (stutter) collectible booklet. I keep it where I know where it's gonna be.  We also have teaser trailers, TV spots and more.  Very, very good movie. Very, very interesting to watch. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, you never know what's gonna happen next. Hannibal Lecter is one twisted character and this movie's all about him.  (uhh) I'm going to give Silence of the Lambs five out of five stars, I'm going to recommend that you see it out there expotv. Have a good night.	6.403
Hi, I'm Valerie, and today I'll be reviewing the film Saving Private Ryan. (umm) It's starring Tom Hanks and it's winner of five Academy Awards. It's a very very amazing movie. (umm) It takes place during (uhh) one of the World Wars and (umm)  Tom Hanks, he's in the military and he is sent on a mission to save this (uhh) Private Ryan, who is still out in the (uhh) war zone. And so they have to locate him and bring him back. And so  (umm) along the way they encounter all these different scenarios and you really see (umm)  a very realistic glimpse of what the war was actually like, the end and stuff. It's very very (uhh) realistic, powerful war type movie. So if you're interested in films like this, and even if you're not, it's definitely worth giving it a chance. (umm) I really enjoy this movie and it's  a very very nice film. (umm) It even has a   some special features. (umm) It has an exclusive message from Steven Spielberg, he's the director of this film, and (uhh) they have the cast and filmmakers bios. So, it's really fun to see, you know, what other films these actors have worked on. So, the special features are also very fun. So I rate it a five out of five, and again, that's Saving Private Ryan.	2.38
Hi Expo TV Land, it's me Danny Erickson here to talk to you about a movie currently in theaters. (umm) August Rush. This has Freddie Highmore, (stutter) the up and coming young actor, as well as Robin Williams who's consistently disappointing in my opinion. (umm) This movie, (stutter) it was recommended to me by some people who I thought had a good opinion, but I guess they were wrong because this was really a disappointing movie. Even as a family movie it's just way too predictable.  I mean, I like the part about, I liked the musical part of the movie. Because he's a music prodigy and he can create music and just has, is in tune with music and (uhh) in a  special way. But, the whole premise of the movie is just,  just so cheesy, and it's so predictable the whole movie. (umm) twenty minutes in I felt like I knew what was going to happen like every every (stutter) part of the movie. So I just thought it was (Uhh) good performance by Freddie Highmore and a lame performance by Robin Williams. But it was just overall pretty disappointing movie because it got such high appraisal from some people, and I just think that it's just too corny and predictable for most viewers  who are looking for a, interesting movie.  So (uhh) I would say, if you had a choice between watching August Rush and not watching August Rush I'd choose not watching August Rush.	5.972
Hi, this is my video opinion of xXx: State of the Union.  Hi, my name is Will, and this is my video opinion of (uhh) XXX State of the Union. I thought that you know, this was a okay movie.  I liked the first one better because it was original, and this one (uhh) is pretty much Ice Cube getting leftovers. That's how I viewed it as. You know, it's a lot of scenes with things blowing up, lot of missions accomplished. (uhh) You know, it kind of reminded me of you know, Ice Cube's role in Torque, which I wasn't too thrilled about. (umm) It had a couple cool car scenes. (umm) You see a very fast car in the movie and you know, and it's kinda It's a concept car that I saw at the (uhh)  at the North American (uhh) Car Auto Show but, you know it's, it (stutter) was an okay movie.  You know, it wasn't anything too spectacular. It was pretty much expected. Plot didn't go anywhere. Few, a a (stutter) few minor twists. Nothing too much that wasn't really expected or couldn't be you know, foreseen.  (umm) Overall, it's just okay. You know, if you if you (stutter) like remakes, or you know, sequels to (uhh) you know, okay movies, then you know you might wanna check this one out.	5.745
Hi today I'm reviewing the DVD of the movie Better Off Dead.  Better Off Dead is a story of a young man from northern California played with enthusiasm by John Cusack. Starring one of his mid,  his many mid-eighties teen comedies and just a few (stutter) years away from his breakout role in the movie Say Anything.  Cusack's family is mostly deranged, as are the supporting characters that fill the world of this teenage ski comedy.  As Cusack's character tries to win back his girlfriend from a ski jock, he begins to fall for a French foreign exchange student.  As you watch the movie you'll probably remember the smaller characters than anything else, including the Asian guy who talks like Howard Cosell, and the newspaper delivery boy who wants his two dollars. There is also a very bizarre scene which you can see behind me, featuring a claymation hamburger version of David Lee Roth's (stutter) dancing and singing to the Van Halen song Everybody Wants Some.  The DVD is completely bare-bones, which is about what you would expect the kind of treatment you would expect for a little-known eighties teen comedy. It is worth a look if you like these kinds of movies, or if you're just a fan of John Cusack. What it lacks in great acting it makes up for in fun characters and one-liners. Overall I give the movie only about a two-and-a-half out of five stars, and the extras only a one out of five.	2.646
Hello Expo TV, how you guys doing today? I am here (uhh) to review the new blockbuster movie Vantage Point. (uhh) I think this movie got number one over (uhh) the weekend. Probably because there much else there. Because this movie I I (stutter) wouldn't recommend at all. (umm) It does have some good actors in it though, Forrest Whitaker, Dennis Quaid (umm) etcetera etcetera. There's tons of it, but  (uhh) it it it (stutter) doesn't really go anywhere. (umm) It just keeps, you get tired of it kind of keep repeating itself to see these different vantage points. I thought it'd do that even a little bit different and better but, it didn't even do that. (umm) I can't recommend at all going to this movie. (umm) I I'd (stutter) say wait for TV. (uhh) This just just was a bad movie. (umm) Maybe a couple good spots, but not worth the (uhh) ticket price. (umm) That is Vantage Point. That is all, thank you.	4.243
Hey how you doing? My name is Roger. I'm gonna tell you about a movie I saw this weekend. (umm) I actually saw it in the in the (stutter) the discounted movie theater and it was called Mad Money and (umm) this movie starred Queen Latifah, Katie Holmes, Holmes Cruise whatever you wanna call her, and also Diane Keaton. (umm) This was a okay movie. I mean (stutter) thankfully I was (stutter) I felt good about going and paying the discount price for it. I didn't think it was really that great. It wasn't a blockbuster hit. It was just kind of entertaining. (umm) Basically it was about these three women (uhh) well it started off with Diane Keaton who was in the upper middle class (umm) person who, her and her husband come across some really hard times and (uhh) they so she goes and gets a job. Well she starts working at the federal reserve (umm) bank where they where they (umm) destroy all the money and in her mind, she's thinking look at all this money that's being destroyed. It's taken out of circulation. (umm) You know, how can she you know, xxx kinda devious and (umm) so she gets with, hooks up with Queen Latifah and Katie Holmes who already work there  and work out a way to steal this money. So it's it's (stutter) kind of (stutter) comical. Katie Holmes plays, I don't can't remember too many things I've really seen her in. (umm) But (umm), she plays a real kind of ditzy type girl, you know, fun loving, young. I mean, so she comes across pretty good. Queen Latifah you know, comes across as the the (stutter) strong black woman and (umm) you know with a family that she wants to take care of. Very good portrayal of that and Diane Keaton (umm) you know the thing about Diane Keaton is  everytime she's in a movie she always plays the same type of role. She is an older white woman that's married that's kind of middle class upper middle class. (umm) She she (stutter) always looks the same, she always acts the same, she even almost always dresses the same. So you know that kind of was a kind of a bummer cause there's like same thing where every movie she's in she kinda looks the same. But the movie was okay. I mean I wouldn't run out and go buy it, but if you're looking for something it's it's it's (stutter) good for all ages. I mean it's fine I mean not real young children but you know, it's an okay family movie. But it does deal with stealing and consequences of stealing and I'm not gonna tell you how it ended and all of that but you know it's it's (stutter) an okay movie. (umm) Like I said I wouldn't run down there and hit it at the video store but if there's nothing else that you can see that you want, then maybe pick that one up. But it's called Mad Money. Alright thanks.	5.066
What's up Expo Tv. I have a movie review called College Road Trip. Came out March two thousand eight. (uhh) Went to see this with my younger sister. It was absolutely terrible. It was directed by Roger Cumble and it's (uhh) about how (stutter) this high student which is (stutter) Raven from (stutter) That's So Raven (uhh)  goes around the country to choose a college that she wants but her dad who's a cop but played by Martin Lawrence, (uhh) goes along with her to try and find the perfect college for her. And (uhh)  it's just a really terrible movie to and, terrible attempt at a comedy. It's definitely directed towards like a younger generation cuz of like Raven was in it.  (uhh) But  it was absolutely terrible. I do not recommend checking this out. If I could give it a zero I would but I know there's no option for zero so I'm going to have to give College Road Trip a one out of five and recommend that everyone stays away from this movie. I don't know why they released this in theaters, it doesn't deserve to be in theaters. (uhh) So College Road Trip a one out of five.	3.0
Hey Expo tv this is my video review of the movie   ten thousand B.C.  (umm)  If you know anything about the director you know he directed Independence Day,  and he also I believe directed The Patriot.  Both those movies  were excellent and I think ninety-nine percent of the population will agree with you on that. However,  if you're like me and you use that to say, hey, let's go see ten thousand B.C. it's by that guy who directed Independence Day. You're going to be highly disappointed. This movie is horrible. It's about these like people just running around doing pointless stuff  that you don't care about. {cough} I would almost describe it as like a reality tv show from ten thousand B.C. like I don't care  about this guy running around in the jungle.  I just want this to end. {cough} There's really like, I didn't (stutter) catch too much of a plot like there's like (umm) there's this little plot that's stupid.  The movie has no substance.  It's not interesting, it's not gonna hold your attention. And it is really long, like I don't know I don't know (stutter) the exact minutes or anything but  I would say it's got to be close to two hours long and that is.  For a movie that sucks this bad, two hours is way too much, so.  {cough} I don't know I mean,  you can rent this movie and just fast forward it through the boring parts but, I think you would miss about an hour and a half of the movie if you did that. And I'm not going to necessarily say that's a bad thing.  So this is ten thousand B.C.  If you're really into like,  old things that suck,  I would recommend this movie fully to you. But for everyone else  I really think this is a giant miss of a movie from a great director  who I'm not even sure if I can say he's great anymore because he did this movie.  (umm) I would just go pop Independence Day {cough} watch that a few times and then call it a night. Big thumbs down for ten thousand B.C.	6.164
Hi I'm Tom and today I'm gonna be reviewing Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns. As a formality here's the movie ticket.  Here  and here's the movie ticket sideways, that's not a formality that's just for fun.  Alright, now if you've seen any of the other Tyler Perry movies this is exactly like it, so if you like those, you'll like this.  It's too much for me at this point if I see another Tyler Perry movie I'm never gonna go see it. The only one saving grace for this movie was Medea. Medea's always hilarious. I I (stutter) don't know why but Tyler Perry dressed up as a large, tall woman  makes me laugh.  Don't know about you, but it does me. Now this movie is yeah, as I said, exactly the same as the other ones, it's like a love family type story. (uhh) Way too many stereotypes, I I wanna (stutter) I wouldn't recommend this movie. Not one bit. I would just wait for it to come out on a network television when it gets replayed three times for a weekend and then every other weekend for the rest of its life.  So no, please don't go see this movie it's horrible.  Unless you like the others then go see this, otherwise wait. Thank you, have a good day.	6.055
Hi. Today I'm reviewing the movie, The Happening. (umm) The Happening is the latest movie from writer director M. Night Shyamalan, who previously directed the good movies Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs. And the not so good movies The Village and Lady in the Water.  (umm) Unfortunately, this one can't even fit into the not so good movies category (umm)  I'll get to that in a little bit. (umm) The movie stars Mark Wahlberg as a science teacher and Zooey Deschanel as his wife  (umm)  and also stars John Leguizamo as his friend. And  something happens at the beginning of the movie and, for some reason, people start talking funny and killing themselves.  (umm)  The cause of this is never fully explained. (umm) There are theories that are thrown about and the  big theory is pretty silly. (umm) {clears throat}  My problem with this movie isn't so much the plot. (umm) It was probably a good idea when M. Night Shyamalan created it, when he thought of it, (umm) but unfortunately, most of the time, the actors actually find themselves walking or running, rather, away from the wind. They run away from the wind.  (umm) If that sounds exciting to you then maybe you can go check this movie out, but otherwise, don't bother. (umm) The problem is also that the dialogue and the acting are atrocious. (uhh) That's probably the best word I can use to describe this movie is just atrocious. (umm) The Village and Lady in the Water were sub-par movies compared to the three movies that he made originally, but they were at least well made films (uhh) this I'm surprised this movie actually got any kind of release, any kind of distribution. The dialogue is horrible. (umm)  Dialogue's never really been his strong suit, but he usually casts decent enough actors or, at least, gets the best out of the actors that he casts to make up for it. (uhh) With Bruce Willis or Mel Gibson, (umm)  Paul Giamatti, (uhh) Bryce Dallas Howard, they're all decent actors in his movies. (umm)  I don't know if it was teaming up with Mark Wahlberg, who has is notori notoriously (stutter) wooden actor  I don't know if that hurt the film, or not, but he also did not get anything out of John Leguizamo or Zooey Deschanel, who are usually pretty fine actors themselves. So, I don't know what exactly happened here, but the acting, it feels like the words are being read off of a script. As you're watching the movie it looks like they're actually looking at cue cards and reading these words for the first time, that's how the delivery is. And it doesn't help that the words they're delivering are just dumb. (umm)  I almost walked out of the movie, but I wanted to stay till the end. I wanted to see  how it wrapped up. (umm)  The beginning of the film where the construction workers start to kill themselves, it's towards the very beginning of the film, (uhh) that was the first real sign of trouble, for me, was the acting by the lead construction worker. And, from there, it just went downhill and it went really over the top when  (uhh) they were in some diner and a lady is looking at her iPhone, which is horrible product placement, and watching some ridiculous video about a guy in a tiger pit. Obviously CG. Bad CG. Just terribly done. Terribly delivered dialogue while they're watching it. It's just an awful movie. I'm only gonna give this one one out of five stars. I don't recommend anybody ever seeing this. (uhh) This is the kind of movie that's gonna to be ridiculed in five years on DVD by drunken Frat boys because it's just that awful. (umm) I was really disappointed.	4.83
Hey Expo TV, today I'm reviewing The Happening. (umm) This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen and that's not even a lie. I've I've (stutter) seen a lot of really bad movies, I walked out of a couple movies. And I would have walked out of this one if I hadn't been praying for M. Night Shyamalan to pull something at the very end. (umm)  Mark Wahlberg was terrible, he will never get a job after this hopefully, because he was so bad in this movie. And M. Night Shyamalan wanted this to be campy and like a two hour long Twilight Zone and with even worse actors than they had back in the day. (umm) They were actually really good in Twilight Zone, this is this is (stutter) that was a insult to the Twilight Zone this is a terrible movie. (umm) I know people are rooting for M. Night Shyamalan I know that  you know, he hasn't made a movie since Lady In the Water, god forbid that movie too. He's just on, (stutter) he hit his peak at twenty-three years old, like this kid he he (stutter) doesn't know what he's doing any more. The Sixth Sense was a beautiful movie, it was a beautiful film I love that film. (uhh) Unbreakable was pretty good. (uhh) Signs, awesome. (uhh) And then there came The Village which was not great but it was still okay. There was the twist there we counted on M. Night Shyamalan for that, we were like, oh it's the twist and then it came and you're like (uhh). But you know what, that was okay.  Mainly Lady In the Water which was just an atrocity, and The Happening was even worse. It's people running away from wind.  Yup. For twenty-four hours and that's it. They're just running away from wind because it's carrying,  well there's actually no real (stutter) explanation really but they think the trees are trying to poison them because it makes the part of their brain, some chemical part in their brain shut off (umm) so they all kill themselves. So I think what M. Night Shyamalan really wanted to do was make a movie where he could just have people kill themselves in the most creative ways possible, because that's all this was. And it wasn't even that gory, like.  It could have been so much more, it really could have been but Mark Wahlberg just killed it, he killed it. It, he was so unreal in this movie. I mean even in one part an old lady's like, you're gonna kill me in my sleep and he's like, what, no. Like come on, have some emotion, like, don't sound like me {laughter} sound like a man who's like (uhh) and Zoey Deschanel I like her too but she just did a very poor job in this movie. But like I said maybe he meant it to be really campy and really silly and if he did, good job.  But even then don't go see it, don't even see it as a satire, it's not worth it. It's a terrible film. Terrible. M. Night Shyamalan has got to get back on track, we need another Signs, we need another Sixth Sense, we need another Unbreakable. These were all great films, these were amazing films. He can get back into that, I don't know what's wrong with him why is he doing this, I'm really pissed off at this movie. I was looking forward to this film all summer. I was so psyched about it because I figured it was the comeback, it's the first R-rated movie, it's gonna be grotesque, it's gonna be twisted, it's gonna be awesome.  No, do not waste your money on this film. Don't even waste renting it on DVD. If it comes on cable, see it then.  That's all I can say, don't do not (stutter) see this movie. There's nothing more I can say. I give it one star because it's the lowest I can go but if I could go lower I would. The Happening, don't see it, it will waste your time and it will make you so sad for everyone involved, especially M. Night Shyamalan because  I don't know. He must have a stroke or something between films because this is just so bad I don't know why he thought this would be a good idea. M. Night Shyamalan get your act together and Mark Wahlberg, (uhh) go back to Marky Mark that's what you gotta do but do not go back on film. (umm) And Zoey I've got hope for you, but don't trust M. Night Shyamalan again. Okay, The Happening, do not see this film. Do not see this film.	6.683
What's up expo tv. (uhh) I have a review for a movie called The Happening. (uhh) This movie recently came out about two weeks ago. It's and it's (stutter) rated R for violent violent (stutter) images. (uhh) It's like a, it's starring Mark Wahlberg. (uhh) That's all I really recognize from the movie. And it's from like the producer of (uhh) or,  of like (uhh) Signs and this, (stutter) Sixth Sense. And (uhh) the movie is about how there's this like, (stutter) parent, this like, random thing and just, (stutter) like threating off like like like (stutter) it, like basically every person. And it's just making them do crazy stuff and like everyone's just like dying and stuff it's really, really weird. (uhh)  But it was interesting but it was like kind of like, this can't be happening like, what like, what's going on why are all these people just going crazy. Because like, just something in the like, air or something. So I thought it was kind of like weird. But you but you (stutter) guys might like it. (uhh)  It was  I guess it was like definitely along the lines of Signs and like Sixth Sense, of those movies. But it wasn't as good. It was just like, a little bit more like violent and I guess that's why it they rated it R. But (uhh) it's not like scary, it doesn't really freak you out or, or nike huarache so myself so if you're looking to go see a scary movie, do not see this this (stutter) movie. It's not good.  So so so (stutter) I would have to give The Happening a two out of five.   {no audio}   (uhh) That's all I have to say.	2.0
What's up Expo TV. I have a (stutters) movie review for a Mike Meyers new movie called The Love Guru. Came out last week. Like there's been a lot of trailers  for it.  (uhh) it's ninety minutes long. It's rated PG-thirteen for crude and sexual content, language, some violence and drug references. (uhh) The movie's about how he was adopted by a by gurus. Like who are basically like, like, like, (stutter)  they know everything about dating and love and stuff and (uhh)  like he gets sent on this mission to like, I guess help out a marriage between between (stutter) Toronto Maple Leafs  player and like his wife because his wife has been seeing a guy from from the Los Angeles Kings. So (uhh) It's  So it's like so it's like (stutter) how  like he's like trying to help out this marriage. But like it really doesn't work cause it's supposed to be really funny. It's like Mike Myers does stuff like Wayne's World and like Austin Powers and stuff. So like this movie isn't supposed to be like a romantic comedy or something. It's like just  like a, really dull comedy I thought. I really don't like Mike Myers that much. I think he's definitely overrated. And this movie it (stutter) should, like the trailer should not be getting as many like slots, like during commercials that it's it's (stutter) like, getting cause it's really not good. (uhh) But see it I guess, if you like Mike Myers. It's not as good as like, it's not as good as Austin Powers or anything. But (uhh) It's called The Love Guru. (uhh) A couple cameo like appearances from from (stutter) players on the Toronto Maple Leafs and from the Los Angeles Kings so check it out if you want to. I would have to give The Love Guru a two out of five.	3.109
Hey what's up Expo TV? (umm) Stephen Boyd here (uhh) here to  talk about a movie I saw about a week ago. (umm) And I was hoping I would forget about it, that's why I haven't done a review on it yet. (umm) It was a depressing experience  (uhh) to say the least. It was a movie called The Happening, and it was bad, it was really really bad. (umm) Here's the thing,  it was written and directed by, I can never say this guy's name right,M. Night Shamylan I think. M. Night Shmamalan or something like that. But anyways. It's written and directed by him. You all know him. He did The Sixth Sense. He did Signs. (umm) Those movies. And I really love those movies and I, I (stutter) though, you know his other movies weren't as bad as people made them seem, you know they weren't like fantastic, but this movie is just terrible. (umm) Everyones making a big deal because it was his first R rated movie. I was like Oh okay well, you know there's a reason it's probably rated R and  it just kinda sucked. Like I was hopping there'd be more violence because if you go to a rated R movie about like. Oh yeah I guess I should tell you a little bit about the plot. Basically it's like a family on the run from like this, this (stutter) natural crisis that's taking people over and like making them kill themselves in really horrific way, and in the previews you see like three or four people killing themselves  and you're like oh my gosh that's really intense, this is gonna be a really intense movie. But no, the the (stutter) three or four times you see it happening in the previews are the only times it happens in the movie. So basically you could save yourself the time, go on Youtube and watch the preview of the movie, and you would get all the most intense parts of the movie in that preview. (uhh) The rest of the movie (stutter) stunk. (uhh) Mark Wahlberg, terrible, terrible actor. So unbelievable. Dude is so bad, it's just like embarrassing, some of the acting he does. And (uhh) yeah, it just wasn't good. And he, M. Night Shamalyan is always in his own movies. Which, sometimes it's not bad. In this one it's just like stupid. I don't know, he's not a very good actor either. But  (umm) don't even rent this movie. It was so bad. There's so many better things you could do with your time. You could like,  go watch (umm) all the videos that Expo TV rejected for two hours, or an hour and a half, and that would be a better (uhh)  better way to spend your time than to see this movie. So one out of five stars for this movie. It really let me down and also because I gave him a chance. I was like oh, I like your other movies, I'll see this one. Really disappointed, don't waste your time. One out of five stars.	5.745
Hi. Today I'm reviewing Hellboy Two. It's currently playing in theaters right now. (uhh) I went to go see this movie (umm) and  it was a big disappointment. From the trailers it looked (uhh) really action packed and exciting and (umm) kind of like a fairy tale with a darker side. But (uhh)  when I saw it I was just unimpressed. (umm) The little side jokes weren't funny at all, and the acting was just kind of  so bland and just the overall presentation and performance of everything about this movie it just wasn't satisfactory for me. And  I just expected so much more from it. So I didn't enjoy it a whole lot at all. (umm) If I had to give it a rating I'd say it's a two out of five for me. (umm)  It just (uhh)  I didn't enjoy it. It had so much potential and it could have been a whole lot better but it was just  pretty poorly done. And so I wouldn't recommend to see it, but (umm) I guess the target audience would be people in my age group. (umm)  Young people in their twenties, thirties, or young children like teenagers, or even little (uhh) ten-year-olds they may enjoy this cause it's (uhh) I mean they may find the jokes funny but I didn't. It was just (uhh) not adult humor I guess. And (uhh)  so, yeah. Didn't like it. That's it. Hellboy Two.	4.69
Hey everybody this is Tom and today I'm going to be reviewing The Mummy the Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, or the easier way of saying it The Mummy Three. As always, movie ticket,  backwards movie ticket,  movie ticket. Alright. No it wasn't backwards movie ticket, it was the back of.  I digress, let's get into it. Brendan Frasier is back in The Mummy Three.  I don't know why. He must have had too much fun doing the other two, because this movie was not good. Not one bit.  Okay, a little bit of entertainment here and there. (uhh)  The gal who played his wife, (uhh)  from the first one, didn't come back. They aged the son to be older and just like his dad.   Bad idea {laugh}.  (umm) Set in China but with the (uhh) this time the mummy being Jet Li, I like that. (uhh) He can control the five elements just like the other ones. Brendan Frasier's character Rick O'Connell is gonna have to save the day.  Tell me you didn't know that. Just tell me, bring it on. (umm) No, this movie wasn't good. It it (stutter) was entertaining at times. I I (stutter) did like Jonathon a lot, he was funny just like in the last two. You need the comic relief. Otherwise as a movie goes it just wasn't good. (umm)  I wish they wouldn't have come back to do a third one.  Just would have been that simple.  But hey, you know, I like the series so I thought I'm gonna go out and watch this. Probably a lot of you out there did too and I'm sorry if you did {sigh}. It's, I mean okay, it wasn't necessarily horrible, I'm not going to give this a one, but I'm going to give it a two or a three. Still borderline in my head right now, working on it. But no, it just wasn't that good. No, not one bit. The sets were good,  the idea was somewhat there {sigh}.  Just no. I I'm (stutter) going to give it a two out of five. Thanks.	5.745
Hi Expo TV, tonight I wanna talk to you about a movie that I just went to with a friend and a sister in law. We like to go to movies after we get our kids in bed and we usually to go see a chick flick. Well the movie of the (umm) last weekend was The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants Two. And I have to admit, this was not my favorite movie. I had seen the first one, it's a story of four girls who find a pair of pants that magically fit all of them so they each (umm) took the pants for a week (umm) as they went on their summer and  it was the story of what happened to them when they were in the pants. I know it kinda seems funny but anyway (umm) this is the second summer of  the story. And (umm)  I thought it was a little slow I actually found myself yawning at the end of the movie. I was like is this over yet, it just kind of drug on it was a little bit predictable. The story was kind of about you know, the four girls, where their lives are taking them, are they gonna stay (umm) a tight group of four are they gonna grow apart. Just what happens with them and it's just  in my opinion a little bit boring. Granted it was a nice night to get out away from the kids and stuff. But  I think I could have picked a different movie. So it wasn't horrid, but it was a little slow. (umm) So if if (stutter) you want a chick flick this is one you can see. I can't say you're gonna go out feeling inspired or anything like that. But it's a show that you can go ahead and watch. It did make me cry. Most movies you know, kind of chick flicks do but I can't say it was the greatest movie. The characters in it where the same ones from the original movie, (umm) great acting (umm) that kinda stuff. But just I think the story just drug on they could have made some changes that would have made it a little bit better. Some of it was just a little unrealistic at one point, it's not gonna ruin the movie but all four of the girls all magically ended up over in Greece cuz one of the girls was one of the girls (stutter) over there. And the other three just happened to be able to go because the father had extra frequent flyer miles. Okay who really has enough frequent flyer miles to send their daughter and her two friends to Greece the next day. Just a little bit unrealistic but anyway. (umm) This was the movie Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants so you can go check it out for yourself and see what you think. Thanks Expo.	6.351
Hello. I want to talk to you about Death Race starring Jason Statham. (uhh) This movie is sort of a B movie by design. It is produced by Roger Corman who is very famous for directing a lot of movies, especially during the sixties and seventies. It's basic plot story, you know, you take (uhh) some cars and some women and a hero and throw it all together, throw in some violence, and you have a movie. And that was basically his career. He produced (stutter) a lot of car movies back in the day. He actually produced one called (uhh) Death Race Two-thousand. (uhh) Some people thought that this was a sequel to that movie, or a remake of that movie. It's not really. It's got some similarities but it's not really what I would call a remake of that movie. This movie involves a man (uhh) (stutter) or a hero, Jason, who is accused of killing his wife and he has to go to prison. He's wrongly accused I should say. And (uhh) once there he gets involved in sort of a underground race to the death (uhh) with the prisoners. And the plot beyond that is basically there is no plot beyond that. There's a lot of explosions and a lot of violence, and (uhh) the action is pretty good but all in all I kind of miss the plot. I I (stutter) like some of the older B movies but but (stutter) when they try to update it and kind of make it into an A movie but keep the B movie plot it just didn't work. So I would say this movie is probably two stars (uhh) for some of the action scenes which are pretty good, but overall I don't think it's worth your time.	3.873
Hello everyone. Playing over my shoulder, unfortunately is this movie and this is Star Trek five: The Final Frontier, the two disc special collector's edition. (umm) This this (stutter) movie is is pretty obnoxious I have to say. (uhh) The fourth movie is is (stutter) known for being a very funny movie which I completely agree with. It is a very funny movie. This movie (uhh) tries to be funny. It tries very very hard to be funny and seems as effortful in it's attempts at humor as the previous movie did (uhh) seem effortless (uhh) in in terms of being funny and this movie tries so hard to be funny and just fails at every twist and turn. It is about (umm)  a (uhh) a Vulcan who commandeers the Enterprise, cast and crew and all, and (uhh) tries to find God at the end of space and it's (uhh) just as obnoxious as it sounds. It (uhh) was directed by William Shatner and he completely screws it up and it was the first movie he ever directed and they shouldn't have let him direct it because this is a franchise that I really enjoy. The first one is kind of mediocre but the rest of em are all really good, with the exception of this one and (uhh) they followed up my beloved fourth one with this (uhh) steaming pile of garbage. (uhh) The special edition features for this (uhh) steaming pile of garbage (uhh) are as follows. There's a commentary with William Shatner and his daughter, who wrote a book about the process of making this movie. I can't wait to listen to it and listen to him try to defend himself. There is also a text commentary by the co-authors of the Star Trek encyclopedia. (uhh) That's on disc one. Disc two has the Star Trek universe featurettes. (uhh) production featurettes about previsualization models and (uhh) press conference for Star Trek five. There's deleted scenes, although I can't imagine watching, wanting to watch any more of this movie outside of what's contained in the previous thing. (uhh) There's advertising, theatrical trailers and TV spots, which I enjoy watching. I really like watching TV spots and there's a production gallery. (umm)  I don't like this movie. I I got it in a in a set with all the other Star Trek movies and (uhh) I figured well you know, they're so inexpensive, I mine as well get this one. Maybe it's not as bad as I thought it was. Maybe it's not as bad as I remember. But it is as bad as I remember it's every inch as bad as I remember. I don't recommend it.	6.055
Hey Expo Tv Eric here, got a DVD for this it is the new, (uhh) this came out last week. The new David Bazan DVD (uhh) at the microphone. Or alone at the micrphone sorry. (umm)  David Bazan (uhh) if you don't know he was the frontrunner of (uhh) Pedro the Lion and also (uhh) The Headphones. And now he's just doing solo stuff and he does have a new album hopefully coming out this year probably the spring of next year. Anyways this just came out October fourteenth and it's sixty-four minutes long. And what it (stutter) consists of is just him (uhh) playing songs (umm) and doing some interviews here and there. And some of the songs are everyone of you, which is a headphones one that he's playing. (uhh) Two moving parts, (uhh) options, the sole system is erased, shit talker, priests and paramedics, (umm) and it's a couple newer songs. It's (uhh) if you give a little, look at that there it's just guitars and pretty plain sample of the setlist and the inside has got the whole track listing and the interview segments. (uhh) If you're a Dave Bazan fan you have to pick this up. Just to have really and to show off to all your friends it's what I did and they loved it. (uhh) The only thing is, it, if you know the songs on here and you're gonna watch him play like it's actually kind of boring. (umm)  I mean they're good songs (uhh) I preordered this and (uhh) I don't know how it works now but if you I think whenever you order this online you get a (umm) a, you get all the songs (uhh) just you know an audio version just so you can have them play, which is really cool. (umm) This came out via (uhh) bar soup records, which he's on now. Which you might know Deathcab for Cutie's on that. (umm) It, but I mean, but it's a great DVD (uhh) if you're a Dave Bazan fan. (uhh) The interview segments are really good. (uhh) He talks about (uhh) songwriting and his family, (uhh) playing live and (uhh) love songs.  And so the main overall, I mean it's like I've been saying it's a good DVD if you're a Dave Bazan fan, (umm) and if someone you know hasn't listened to him, definitely put this DVD in for them and (uhh) you might be able to get them to turn around and like him.	5.354
Hey. ExpoTV I am DJ Mel here and I will be reviewing myself, no I am not so why did I tell you my name? Anyways, today I am reviewing (stutter) Denzel Washington's Deja Vu. This movie is, this movie is PG thirteen, thirteen, yes (umm) (uhh) This is starring  touched, no (stutter) that's not him I'm sorry (uhh) it is (uhh) brought to you by Jerry Bruckheimer Films and Touchstone Pictures. (umm) I would've, I watched this movie once, four years ago for something, didn't really like it, it's (stutter) suspenseful but, meaningless at the same time and it has a confusing plot so if you're looking for a good watch, like a classic watch like you're going to watch an old movie, (umm) and you're you're (stutter) looking for an action or a suspense movie,  don't get Deja Vu, you'll get like Shanghai Knights. Just any Jackie Chan movie will do. So {laughter} anyways, this this (stutter) not a great movie, so yeah, don't watch it. Thanks for watching.	4.435
Hi Expo, today I wanna do a movie review for you of a movie currently in theaters and that is Confessions of a Shopaholic. And I have my ticket stub here for Confessions of a Shopaholic. Confessions of a Shopaholic is (umm) based on a series of novels (stutter) by Sophie Consella. (umm) And it is about a girl named Becky Bloomwood who is obsessed with shopping.  This particular film (umm) I've read the novels and they're really good I guess you could say chick lit. (umm) Very fluffy, very entertaining, but this movie was absolutely awful. (umm)   Which, I think you can kind of tell from the previews it's gonna be not so funny. (umm) In the novels Becky Bloomwood is, you know,  I think that her character is a little bit smarter but in this movie she comes off as very dumb. And the message at the end of the movie isn't very good. (umm) I don't think. And it's just over the top and the character of Becky is just not very strong and the acting I also thought was not very good (umm)  (umm) for that character. I would definitely recommend that if you've read the shopaholic books to absolutely not go see this movie, and if you haven't read the shopaholic books too absolutely not go see this movie cuz it's it's it's (stutter)  really awful. I (umm) it doesn't have a good message, no good characters, the characters are portrayed as dumb (umm) and over the top, so don't go see it. Do not go see Confessions of a Shopaholic.	5.354
Hey expo, it's Carl here. I wanted to review  Public Enemies. (umm) It's a movie I saw last week, it's got (uhh) Johnny Depp and Christian Bale in it. It was really good. It's the story of (umm)  John Dillinger. (uhh) He was a criminal bank robber in the nineteen-thirties.  And it sort of just follows his story (umm)  after he got out of jail for the first time and it's just really interesting. There's a lot of action, there's a lot of suspense, (umm) and it's like really, it's really well done. The filming (umm)  it was really interesting (uhh) the,  the way it was filmed. It was, it was really cool so  I liked that a lot. (umm) It's a really good story. (umm) There's some love, there's some suspense, there's some action and it's  I liked it a lot, I don't know what else I can say about it. (umm) It's pretty long, it's about two and a half hours long, maybe a little too long. But, you know, it was good. (umm) so if you're looking for a good movie to go see check out Public Enemies. (umm) It's in theaters now.	4.082
Hi, today I'm doing a review on my (umm) favorite holiday film. (umm) This is the movie Elf  (umm) with Will Ferrell (umm) and it's just a great movie (umm) to watch. It's very funny. (umm) It's talking about a orphan who falls into Santa's bag and gets taken home with him (umm) back to Santa's workshop and (umm) an elf raises him and he's not an elf, he's a human and (umm) he (umm) grows up thinking that he is an elf and it's just a hilarious (umm) movie to watch. He comes back trying to find his real father and biological father and (umm) it's very funny to watch. So I highly recommend that you get Elf to watch during your holiday (umm) movie watching time and (umm) everyone will love it and they'll all have a good laugh and (umm) it's it's (stutter) just a great Christmas movie to watch, so I highly recommend you get it.	4.082
Hey there Expoers. Today I'm reviewing the movie  Elf. This is by far my favorite Christmas movie. It's so good that I even watch it when it's not Christmas. Here's the little proof of  purchase there. Get the DVD. I've had this one. It's just one of those movies that you just gotta own, you know? I mean it's just so funny  and (uhh)  I mean my favorite part has gotta be the aww man there's just so many good ones. When, I mean when he tried to give that raccoon a hug and  it attacks him, and when he picks the chewing gum off, and  when he buys his father that special something. I mean, that's just, that's good stuff. Will Ferrell in this movie.  Funniest man alive. (uhh) this is back when, you know, he was sort of starting his movie runs but (uhh) just such a great, very kid friendly too. (umm)  he didn't do anything stupid because a lot of these days people you know they're adding some like just things that aren't really needed in (uhh)  and you know they're just, they're just (stutter) dumb inappropriate things that they throw in these movies nowadays and so. This is just a nice clean movie and it's just hilarious and fun and cute and you know.  It's a great family movie so (uhh) we watch it every year at Christmas so I (uhh) hope you enjoy the review and go out and see Elf. Rent it or Netflix or something. It's a great movie.  Bye guys. Thanks.	6.683
This is a review of the most recent movie that I've seen, and (umm) it was Harry Potter and I saw it on, well, I saw the midnight premiere, so it was Friday the twenty-third of July. June.  June. And (umm) so this is my ticket. Harry Potter.  It says Friday the twenty-second because I saw the type of thing where you see the first part of (umm) Harry Potter seven, and then right after you see the (stutter) second part. So the first part started at eight forty,  and (umm) I really liked that because it. (umm) Lets you refresh the memory (umm) of what happened in the first part of the movie. But I don't think they're having that any more.  But I really do I really did like the movie. They did a really, really great special effects. (umm) I loved the fight scenes, usually I'm not a huge fight scene fan in movies, but it was really great and had you sitting on the edge of your seat, so I really did like that. (umm) The special effects was great, everything looked so realistic. The acting was great, they really come into their characters. (umm) And I really my favorite part of the movie is at the end, when it has the  (umm) shot into the future of what Harry, Ron and Hermione are going to be like in the future. Really, really loved that part. So I really recommend this movie. Buy it on DVD when it comes out, it's a really great movie.	3.0
Hello, I'me here today to talk about  Conan The Barbarian. This is the latest Conan The Barbarian. (uhh) Little background, I am a fan of the original Conan The Barbarian movies with Arnold Schwarzenegger (uhh) But I'm more of a fan of the comic book Conan. That's why I went to see this movie. (umm) I kinda knew that it wasn't gonna be the greatest movie in the world when I went to see it because the reviews weren't that great and it's not really doing that great at the box office. But I have heard that it's closer to the comic book in the way that  it was originally intended to be when it was written, and by that I mean it's a lot more animistic. A lot more goriness and a lot more hacking and slashing than your typical sword and sorcery movie. (uhh) But where this fell short was on (uhh) several points. (uhh) First of all, the acting wasn't that great. Well (uhh) I guess the acting was okay, but the dialogue they were given was not really anything that someone could work with. I thought Jason Momoa did as good as could be expected and I thought it's actually a fairly convincing Conan in looks and actions. And the supporting cast was all big names, but none of em had any roles. (uhh) You know,  Rose McGowan, Rachel Nichols (uhh) Ron Pearlman, they all had little small parts and (uhh)  even the ones that had bigger parts, like Rachel Nichols, didn't really add anything to the movie. (umm) Basically what we get is tons of hacking and slashing. (uhh) If you try to count how many limbs are lobbed off in this movie even if you limit it to limbs that were lobbed off by the ax, you're still gonna lose count somewhere around ten thousand. I mean this movie is just incredibly (uhh) gory and violent and while it is truer to the comics, (uhh) the comics did have plot lines and story lines and this movie, sadly, is just a convoluted mess of a plot line. So I will say that Jason Momoa did a fairly good job being Conan and looking like Conan. (uhh) This Conan movie just (uhh) failed in my opinion.	6.683
