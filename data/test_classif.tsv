Hi my name is Jordan and I'm going to be reviewing   Master and Commander The Far Side of the World.   Well this movie, it has Russel Crow in it.   This movie came out a few years ago and it is awesome.   It is basically about (umm)   about a captain of a ship a long long time ago back in   (uhh) the days of Napoleon and things like that.   And (umm) it is very action packed, well it has a few action packed   sequences.   A lot of people complained about it because they didn't think it had   enough action, but (umm) I thought that it had plenty.   It was really a deep movie.   It showed the life of these people, these sailors while they were   sailing on the ships and I thought that was really interesting.  (umm) The movie's rated PG-thirteen because (uhh)   there's some blood and guts and stuff like that and (uhh) some people   get shot and things, which is natural for a Navy warfare movie,   but (umm) it's really good and it's really (umm)   it has a good storyline, and it's kind of educational.   You really learn some stuff while you're (umm) watching this movie.   So really I recommend it, so (uhh) if you can pick it up.	5.477
Hi, I'm doing my video opinion for Wolf's Rain   Leader of the Pack. This is the (uhh) first DVD in the series.  This is an animated series  and it's a pretty good show. The first DVD in particular, I like a lot. It contains the (uhh) first five episodes and I really like the first episode. It has a lot of nice visuals, some really nice music.  This show is   (umm) it doesn't really tell you if it's in the future or not from now. But it's just like in a different world. It's really harsh  (uhh) humans are struggling to survive,   but there are also wolves, which are  well they they're (stutter) magic wolves then they can masquerade as humans, walk around with humans and humans look at them and the look just like humans.   But they're really wolves and   (uhh) there's also like high count type people who   seem to be humans but they're of like a royal lineage   and they   want all the wolves dead and  they fight them and there's also humans that know about the wolves and   (uhh) they can't necessarily see them   but they they (stutter) know that they exist and they they (stutter) wanna try to kill them.   They think that they're evil,   they think that they're bloodthirsty, which isn't always the case just like with humans  and the wolves are on a search for paradise.  It's all a very   it's   (uhh)   the whole show is just full of metaphors and it's (stutter) a really cool show though. If you like anime, I think you should check out Wolf's Rain.  The first DVD I give, five out of five stars.	4.082
Hi my name's Leon and   (umm) a couple of weeks ago I went to see Borat The Movie, (uhh) starring Sacha Baron Cohen.  (umm) It's an interesting movie to say the least.   (umm) I thought it was hilarious, just how he explored it.   How   backwards this country can be and how easy it is to   confuse people in this country.  (umm) There's one scene that was kind of gross.  Two big naked men rolling on the ground, sorry if I spoiled that for you.  But (uhh)   it'd keep you happy to know that.  Overall I thought it was a great movie. (umm) Very funny.   (umm) A little off the walls, a little crazy. I can't believe he got away with all that.   But, I'd recommend you go see it if you're willing to  push your own boundaries  (umm) sexually and   (uhh) conceptually. {laugh}  If you If you (stutter) can think of that.  (umm) It's a great movie, (umm) I recommend it.  It's just, one of those movies you have to see because it's so outrageous.	4.435
Hi, I'm here to tell you about the Billy Madison Happy Gilmore   Collection.    This has both features and then you can open up either side to see about the movies.    It tells you the bonus features on each flap.  This is a great film for any Adam Sandler fan. (umm), I love both of these movies   in particular I'm a really big Billy Madison fan where he goes back to school   but my dad loves Happy Gilmore where he's an angry golfer.    Just wants money to save his grandmother's house.    So, this is a really great gift for anyone who's an Adam Sandler fan.    This edition costs twenty dollars. You can get it just about anywhere.  (umm), both films are really good.  Whether you like one or the other  it's it's (stutter) a great gift for any Adam Sandler fan, and I highly recommend this.	3.464
This is (umm) the DVD movie Lilo and Stitch. (uhh) This is a Walt Disney animated movie. This isn't a computer generated animated movie, this is straight hand drawn old school style animation. (uhh) Lilo and Stitch is a bright and edgy comedy that's about finding true friendship and (umm)  even if that means you're from two different planets. Basically Lilo, who is (uhh)  this one right there, (uhh) is a little Hawaiian girl who's kind of a loner, kind of a lonely person. Ends up finding this little alien who is just this crazy, funny little furry guy who's a really good surfer named Stitch. And they get together and they have all sorts of wild and crazy Disney adventures in the wonderful land of Hawaii and (umm) they just hang out together. Basically  it's a nice children's movie (umm) that can be enjoyed by the family. So if you're looking for a good Disney animated movie check out Lilo and Stitch.	4.359
If I were a rich man. {singing}  You ever wonder where that came from? It's not Gwen Stefani, If I Were a Rich Girl. {singing}  This is the original. It's the film of course. (umm) My parents have both seen this (uhh) multiple,   multitudes of times in actual, like, play form.  So, my dad bought this for my mom.  I had never seen it before until this film, so,  I was not let down. It is very well done.  (umm) It has a lot to do with Jewish culture and things like that.  (umm) Some other great songs besides the (uhh) If I were a rich man song is (uhh)  matchmaker, matchmaker make me a match.  (umm)   Yeah. It's it's (stutter) a great story. It's it's (stutter) one of those movies that until you see it you really can't describe it. (umm)  It's described as the most powerful movie ever made. I wouldn't, (umm) (stutter) movie musical ever made. I wouldn't say that, because I really like Phantom. However,  it was really good. It's one of those must-sees. (umm)  I really liked this movie and I would recommend it to everyone as, (uhh)  like, who's a fan of musicals or is a fan of just Jewish culture  or who just wants to see a really good movie. (umm)  I give it five stars.	6.683
Hello, I'm Matthew and I'm here to talk to you about this movie  called Groundhog Day.  It came out in the early early nineties, nineteen-ninety in fact and it stars Bill Murray,  which at his time,  was one of the best and most popular comedians.  It tells the story of a news anchor that has to go cover the story of this groundhog  and the unusual thing is that he gets stuck in a groundhog time warp thing where he lives the same day over and over and over again for years and years and years, probably on end. And he learns to  know what everything happens in town, when it happens, how it happens. He knows everything about everything and he's trying to get this girl to fall in love with him.  It's very funny. If you like Bill Murray, I think you will absolutely love this film. I'm a big fan of Bill Murray and I think this is one of his funniest films he's ever made.  (umm) This particular version cost fourteen dollars. It's on DVD and  it is widescreen  and like I said you'll absolutely laugh and love this film and I would highly recommend it.	4.359
Okay, here I have   the movie   Bottle Rocket.   This is a Nineteen ninety six adventure comedy drama.   It is Wes Anderson's first feature film   and it's also cowritten by Owen Wilson.   (umm) Actually both the Wilson brothers star in this movie and it is their   debut film.   (umm)   This movie is about best friends who decide to just (uhh)   pursue life in crime.   (umm) It's a pretty strange movie as most Wes Anderson movies are.   But it's pretty funny. (umm)   The New York Post called it an oddball project. (umm)   I think that   there's been mixed reviews   (umm) as far as I know about this movie, so some people love it some people don't.   I definitely think you should give it a chance if you're a Wes Anderson fan and   you have to see his first movie. Or the   Wilson brothers, definitely pick up this movie it's called  Bottle Rocket. It's   something that I think you should pick up or at least have in your collection.   It's kind of weird kind of quirky kind of crazy but,   Bottle Rocket definitely just give it a chance.	4.83
Okay, so here we have the movie   Dirty Dancing. It's a classic, if you haven't seen it you need to go pick it up.   (umm) This is the ultimate edition, which it has two discs.   (umm) There's an insane amount of features on this so if you like this movie then I definitely think you should pick up the ultimate edition DVD set. If you haven't seen this movie, it was released in nineteen eighty seven. It's a comedy, it features Patrick Swayze   (umm) Jennifer Grey. It was actually a low budget film, but obviously now it's a really huge hit.   (umm) The soundtrack is one of the best selling of all time. It's about this girl Baby who goes on vacation with her family. She falls in love with a dance instructor, hence the title Dirty Dancing.  (umm) It's definitely one of my most favorite movies.  (umm) Their love was forbidden because her father didn't approve of it.  (uhh) In the end they realize that Johnny is an okay guy. This is usually a movie that girls like more than guys. But hey, try and get your boyfriend to watch it with you.   (umm) But definitely Dirty Dancing.	5.745
This is a movie. It's a DVD, it's called The Secret of Nikola Tesla, T-E-S-L-A, and   (uhh) if you don't know who Nikola Tesla is, he's the guy back in the turn of the century he worked with George Westinghouse and   (uhh) some other famous guys in developing the   (uhh) actually Tesla came up with the idea for the AC motor  and the AC generators and motors, some electrical stuff. And  (umm) this movie is kind of a story about his life and I'll just read some of this.  This (stutters) his achievements, Nikola Tesla, lead to the discovery of the radio and television as well as the development of the first hydroelectric dam, remote control, radar tracking for the military, x-rays   and manipulation of matter and energy. So this guy was really smart guy back then and (uhh)  and he made a large contribution towards, you know, the electronic age we have today.  And (uhh) I was seeing  documentaries on Nikola Tesla's life and I much rather see the documentaries than this movie. This movie   (uhh) you know, is in the movie format. So it kinda you know, it's like his life from a child you know, to when he's grown up til he's  dealing with all these electronic things and other powerful men like J.P. Morgan.  And (umm) this movie I would rate like you know, a two out of five. It's not a good movie because the  just the movie was bad. The you know there were some parts in there where, you know, he's talking to his friend in some foreign language and there's no subtitles so it goes on for two or three minutes you don't even know what he's saying.  And the picture quality was really bad and just the story. If I didn't know you know the the (stutter) background of Nikola Tesla I would not  (umm) I couldn't follow the movie too good. So again, I do not recommend this movie  (uhh) at all.  (umm) So  don't buy it.	4.359
Hey shoppers my name is Jeff and this is Gladiator.   It stars Russel Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix.   (uhh) It's set in the time of the Roman empire and when (uhh) Maximus is (uhh)   the head of all of the armies of Rome.   And unfortunately (umm)   when they're (uhh) Roman emperor dies, and (uhh) Joaquin Phoenix takes over he wants (uhh) Russel Crowe to swear his allegiance.   (uhh) Russell Crowe doesn't do that because he believes that the young Joaquin Phoenix has killed (uhh) his father in order to take the (uhh) the throne. (uhh) When that happens (uhh) Joaquin Phoenix's character pretty much (umm)   sends the gladiator to his death, they send him out in the woods and they're gonna kill him but he escapes and   (umm) he gets taken in by (umm) a man who (umm) has (stutter) gladiators on the side   as a trade and they fight.   And it's a story of (uhh) this man   fighting his way through all the gladiator battles in order to get close enough   (umm) to Joaquin Phoenix in order to (umm) kill him   and avenge what this man has done to him and his family (uhh) because his family was killed   and his properties were seized.   (uhh) Russel Crowe (uhh) does an outstanding   (uhh) job in (uhh)   playing this character (uhh) you're so captivated   (umm) by what he's going through that (uhh) you really feel for him and you really get into the movie and it's it's (stutter) a wonderful,   wonderful adventure.   It's (uhh) Gladiator with Russel Crowe.	5.066
Hey y'all, how's it going? My name is Jordan and (uhh) today I'm going to be reviewing the DVD Spy Game.  Now this had Brad Pitt in it, the movie itself had Brad Pitt in it, and Robert Redford and (umm)   when I watched this movie I thought it was boring. (umm)   I, when I went into it I was thinking it was going to be, you know, this big action movie. I mean on the front it has this explosion and, you know, it has all this helicopter and the men moving and everything. But really it's not that action packed at all. It's (uhh) more of a drama kind of movie, and I didn't really get into it at all because I was expecting it to be this huge elaborate, you know, action movie where, you know, stuff blew up and people were shooting and stuff like that, but that that (stutter) wasn't this at all. (umm) It was really more of a psychological drama kind of movie. It really didn't have that much action. So (umm) I don't think I'd really recommend this movie, it's not really that great. So the movie's not that good so I guess y'all should probably stay away from it. (umm)  Special features wise there's a good bit of special features but I just didn't care to see them because I didn't like the movie, so I didn't really care about the special features also, but (umm)  in the in the (stutter) special features they have (uhh) a documentary on how they created some of the (uhh) some of the limited action scenes that they did. You know, there's only a few, but the ones that they did they explained them.   But (umm) other than that I think there's a commentary and theatrical trailer but that's about it. So (umm) really I wouldn't recommend this one, I don't, I don't think this was a really good movie so it's really not worth purchasing. If you must see it though definitely go rent it first. But (umm) but yeah that that's (stutter) about it. This is Spy Game and (uhh) you probably want to skip over this one.	5.745
Hello, and welcome to my review of I Am Trying To Break Your Heart by Sam Jones.    This is a documentary   about Wilco, one of the great American rock bands, and how in the year two-thousand  they began to record their fourth highly anticipated album  and a year later they found themselves with a completed album,  and a label that did not want to distribute, distribute (stutter) it   and this is their story from (uhh), making that album to having that album rejected   and finding another label   and basically it's one of the great (umm) rock coups on the (uhh)  with the music corporation if you will   (uhh) this is   probably, this is probably (stutter) one of the best documentaries I've seen  (umm) that has to do with a band.    It's, (uhh), it's (stutter) there are it's filed with interviews, music, (umm), it's just a great point of view.    When Sam Jones began this documentary he had no idea what was going to happen.    He just loved the band and he wanted to (uhh), make a story, create a story, and he got way more than he bargained for.    This disc, (umm), its a, it's (stutter)two discs and the second disc comes with seventy minutes of extra footage, including   (uhh) seventeen (umm) extra Wilco songs,   (umm) alternate versions of songs.    There's also a featurette.    (umm) This has, this the first disc has a trailer.    This is a great documentary and a must have for any fan of the band Wilco.    (umm) This is I am Trying to Break Your Heart, a band, a film about Wilco by Sam Jones.    I definitely recommend it.	5.686
Hi, my name is Anesh and today I'm reviewing the DVD of the movie Gladiator.  Now Gladiator is a great movie. You know it stars Russell Crowe and Russell Crowe did a great acting there and  this movie actually won a lot of (uhh) Academy Award Awards (stutter).  (umm) Story is that Russell Crowe starts as a general but he's made a slave and then from the slave he becomes a gladiator and you know the whole story shows, (uhh) whole movie shows the courage and you know the determination that this guy has.  (uhh) Absolutely wonderful acting.  (uhh) You know five on five movie anytime.  (uhh) This DVD is a widescreen.   (uhh) It has a lot of extras, specials,  (uhh) such as deleted scenes  (uhh) the documentary where this small kid played by played as Julius in there and   (uhh) lots of extended scenes and commentaries and stuff like that.  (uhh) It's a a great great DVD for your collection. It has to be there.  (uhh) You know, if you like drama if you like fighting and you know blood and stuff like that.  (uhh) I love and I you know and I recommend you to buy it and  (uhh) keep it with you you (stutter) all the time.   (uhh) It's a great DVD. Again my name is Anesh and this is a review of the DVD of the movie Gladiator.	4.435
Hi, I'm   (uhh) reviewing the movie called   (uhh) the Epic movie, which is currently in theaters and   (umm) you know I've seen commercials on TV  and (uhh) it's basically a type of movie like Scary Movie, like the series where they make spoofs of everything, and   (uhh) I've seen it on TV and  (uhh) it looked   (uhh) pretty funny from the (stutter) from the previews that I saw.  (umm) I saw that over the weekend, did did (stutter) good in the box office. I think it got something like over twenty million dollars.  So (umm)  I decided to pay ten dollars, you know, go to the movie theater and see it and   (uhh) gotta tell you that I'm extremely disappointed in the movie.   (umm) For more than half of the movie, I didn't even laugh.  (umm) The only time I did laugh was at the the (stutter) pretty dirty stuff which they usually don't put in movies but, I mean that was pretty funny to me.   (umm) there are a couple of rap music scenes from from BET, that were trying to make fun of, wasn't really funny. So   (umm) this is not a very good parody movie and   (uhh) I wouldn't recommend it at all.	5.066
The movie I will be reviewing for you right now is Final Cut starring Robin Williams.   The idea of this film is very  very interesting.   The whole main tag of this is basically in the end,   he sees everything. See, in the near future,   they have people that   run a machine called the guillotine. What it does is that after you die, it takes all of your memories  that were downloaded on a chip that was implanted in your brain.   And what it does is it allows them to make little snippets for your funeral. Little  (uhh) home movies if you will. Just a reel of movies   to show at your funeral.   Now,   this man sees atrocities. All sources of evil off people throughout his adventures of, well not really adventures but throughout his career of going through everyone's memories and editing them for their  family's consumption at the funeral.  Now as I said, that's a very good premise. That probably have you captured right now like I wanna see Final Cut right now.   It is a good idea, it's executed well to a point. I mean it takes Robin Williams and shows how he's going slowly descend into this abyss of the things I've seen and it just ropes him into a conspiracy. He's seen the memories of the wrong person   and how now people are after him for what he knows.  But just the way they ended the movie was so terrible that,   {sigh} it's not even worth seeing the whole thing because it just, it just lifts you up to a point where you're just like, this is great.   This is the kind of movie that makes you think about how things could end up. How people would be in the future. What people would do after they die and kinda live forever you know.   Like they have their memories on their chip and now people would just be like well this is what he was like and this is what he did. But unfortunately,   the ending of this movie is too horrible and too disappointing to say this is a good movie.   So we'll just leave it at that where it was exciting when it began but when it ended,   it just wasn't worth it.	5.0
Yo, what's up expotv dot com? Today I will be reviewing the skateboard DVD movie   Suffer the Joy, made by Toy Machine skateboards. This is the newest Toy Machine skateboard movie and it is  my favorite so far and  (umm) the skating was okay in it, not as good as in the old one, but the reason I love this video so much is because of the bonus feature entitled Billy's balls.   Billy's balls is, (umm) features one of their team riders, Billy Marks, and he just does the most amazing stuff with ping pong balls.   He (uhh) has a cup filled with (umm) halfway with water, and he sets it like (umm) on a (stutter) ping pong table and then he's like blindfolded and just throws the ball and it lands in the cup. He just does so many (umm) things with ping pong balls. He (umm)  hits one with a golf club and it goes straight into the cup, and he doesn't even get excited about it. He just is so chill and  (umm) that's what made me like him cause he's not a bragger. (umm) Five out of five star video, for sure.	6.055
Hi, I'm here to tell you about this movie that I happen to enjoy quite a bit. This is   a movie that's based off of James Patterson's book Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas, the movie is entitled the same. (umm) this movie was made for  tv, this is a tv movie so you'll probably find it on Lifetime movie a lot.   It's that kind of movie. (umm)   It's a really great movie because it follows the book really well, and if you liked the book   then you'll probably like this because it is pretty close and I've heard complaints from people that have read the book that they hated this, but   I disagree. I   liked the story more than the book itself and when I watched the movie I got the same story out of it than out the book so,   really, I guess it just depends on who you are and what you got out of the story, but   this is brand new, it just came out. You can get it for twenty dollars. I think it's  mainly on Amazon right now, but I'm sure it'll come to other video stores and   Walmart pretty soon. But if you like James Patterson and you liked the book then   I highly recommend this movie.	4.967
Hey my name's Scott and today I'm doing a review on a DVD that I probably should've rented before I went out and bought it.   (umm)  Heard a lot of good reviews about it and a lot of people seem to love this movie,  but (umm) when I actually went out and   bought the DVD and watched it, I was really disappointed.  (umm) I just really didn't like the movie too much.  (umm) I know a lot of people loved it and a lot of people think I'm crazy for not enjoying it, but  it just wasn't my kind of film.  (uhh) The storyline just kind of seemed to drag until it finally got into some action.  But (umm) this is,  (uhh) it has, it has (stutter) a decent amount of special features on it.  all different audios, in (uhh) Mandarin, (uhh) English, French, has subtitles in English and French,  (uhh) it has the "Making of" special,  a widescreen presentation,  a conversation with Michelle Yeoh featurette,  a photo montage, link to website, filmographies, animated menus, production notes, and (uhh) scene selections.  So, (umm)  it's been compared to like The Matrix in ways like that, with sword-fighting and things like that. (umm)  Just wasn't really my kind of film.  (umm) But, you know, you might want to give it a try. Might say to rent it before you buy the DVD though.  (uhh) But if you did like it and you don't have the DVD, definitely pick it up because it does have a lot of good special features.  That's (uhh) Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and (uhh)  give it a shot if you want.	2.38
Right here with me today I have the (umm) little heard of DVD called From Justin to Kelly. (umm) This is actually a musical which came out (umm) a few years ago so (umm) of course it's not as a famous anymore. (umm) It's got America's favorite (umm) (stutter)   people from the American Idol show (umm) Kelly Clarkson and Justin (uhh) Guarini. (umm) So that's of course the two (stutter) major (umm) stars in this show. (umm) Because these are great (umm)  two very talented singers of course this has got to be a musical. It's about (umm) a few people going with their friends to Miami for spring break and then they (uhh) meet up. It's got a lot of music, its got a lot dancing and (uhh) basically the fun never stops in the sun. So (umm)  I wouldn't really recommend getting this because it's (uhh)  there's a reason it wasn't, it didn't get (umm) such good (uhh) ratings because it's actually quite (stutter) a boring (uhh) plot. There's not much of a plot to it, it's just (uhh) people dancing and singing on the beach and (umm)   that's about it. So if you're looking for something with a good plot (umm) I wouldn't suggest this, but maybe if you're looking for something like a sing along type I would suggest this because (uhh) the (umm)  the the (stutter) subtitles actually (umm) the captions and everything actually show up as they're saying the words so it's almost like a sing along kind of movie. So (uhh) in that case if you like that kind of thing I would recommend this to you.	3.367
Forty Days and Forty Nights. This is a pretty silly film with Josh Hartnett.   Basically I think he gives up (umm)  he becomes abstinent for forty days and forty nights for Lent  and (umm) everyone around him, including his friends and all of (uhh) his coworkers, he's a real ladies man, they have a bet that  (umm) you know, how long it will take him to fall off the wagon, if you will.  And so he had (umm) a relationship with his ex-girlfriend that was kind of  shaky and (umm) he meets a new girl while he's taking this vow of celibacy and, and (stutter) it basically (umm) tells the story of their relationship while he's trying to finish this vow of celibacy. And all of his friends, you know, are urging him   to (umm) break it, basically because they have a lot of money riding on it. And it it (stutter) tells the story of (umm) that dynamic as he (uhh) keeps that vow or, I won't give it away but (uhh) it's a pretty silly film. It's It's (stutter) probably worth viewing if you're bored. I would give it a six out of ten.	4.435
This is Enter The Dragon on HD DVD.  Now this movie has been remastered completely for HD DVD and unlike the previous releases, it doesn't have that   (uhh) does have the seventies look but doesn't have all the problems the other previous releases did, including there was a lot of a a lot (stutter) of kind of color mess ups. It wasn't very sharp. Even though it was an older movie, it wasn't exactly filmed on the best cameras or anything.   It looked pretty bad on regular definition DVDs and they have done a fabulous job fixing it up for High Def DVD.  Now (umm) not only is this in ten eighty p and the audio is very nice, but it does include all features on previous SD DVDs. Which means it has four documentaries about Bruce Lee, his life and so on and about the movie. It does have one featurette regarding the filming of the movie, it was just a longer little thing. It has some photo galleries and it also has   (umm) trailers and TV spots.   This isn't anything too exceptional for a regular (uhh) DVD in terms of features,   but it works pretty nice and it looks very good, which is of course the purpose of HD DVD.  Now this isn't a combo disc, this is just a straight up HD DVD. So you can purchase it for around say, twenty dollars at Target, maybe a couple more at Best Buy.  And I would have to say that this is a solid five out of five. Bruce Lee's best film in my opinion and a great way to show off older films in HD.	4.69
Good morning Expo TV. Today I am reviewing The Bourne Supremacy  with Matt Damon as Jason Bourne. This is the second movie in the awesome series. Bourne Identity is the first one. This is when  he's, he was (stutter) peaceful and then they keep searching for him after he escaped them in the first, they keep searching for him. I'm glad to say at the end of this book he really got away and he's  finally   he's finally done with all of the Treadway stuff.   Treadway is the project that got him into this. It's an assassin group, and it really ruined his life.   He was an assassin, but his brain  his mind, just   overwhelmed  and he was unstable and he forgot everything.   This is a great movie. It continues with the  continues with the (stutter) shooting and drama.   On the back, you have scene descriptions and extra stuff that you can get.  (umm) The deleted scenes are kind of funny in this movie. You'd think they would, would be screw up on like actions but they were very funny. I would recommend this movie to for everyone that loved The Bourne Identity and just loves   Matt Damon in general. Thank you.	6.403
I'm reviewing the DVD White Christmas. It's a musical written by Irvin Berlin.  (umm) This one has   (uhh) Bing Crosby and Danny K in it.   As (uhh)   soldiers in World War II Who leave the service and  (uhh) Bing Crosby's already an entertainer and   (uhh) due to a personal favor he (uhh) he owes (stutter) to Danny K, they become   (uhh) partners and they become really popular.   They decide to   (uhh) go to their old generals  (uhh) bed and breakfast in Vermont to help his business by (uhh) doing a show there for him.  (uhh) This is probably my favorite Christmas movie.   (uhh) It is in black and white but, who cares.  (umm) There's (uhh)   not really any kind of special features on here. But that's not really a big deal cause it's such an old movie.   (umm) This movie (uhh)  a little over two hours long. But  (uhh) if you have seen it you should definitely check it out.	3.873
Hello, I'm Matthew and I'm here to tell you about this DVD movie.   It came out in two thousand and five and it is called Birth.   It stars Nicole Kidman.   (umm) She plays a   recently widow   and then it jumps forward to ten years later   and she is getting remarried.   When a mysterious boy comes and pretends to be   her husband reincarnated.   (umm)   The acting was okay. (umm) The directing was okay,  but   I don't know if they were trying to make it (umm) sweet and romantic but   it kind of comes off a little creepy,   a little weird.   (umm) The little boy is about eight or nine in it and she's about thirty, thirty-five.   (umm) Late thirties and it comes off kind of creepy, there's (umm)   (umm) a nude scene involving her and the young child and she's going to run away with him and   (umm) they kiss in the movie and,   and instead of coming off sweet and endearing it comes off a little (umm)   weird and really creepy and a little uncomfortable. So (umm)   I really don't know what Nicole Kidman was thinking but I would not recommend Birth.	4.435
Today I'm going to be doing a (stutter) a movie review of a movie that is currently in theaters right now (uhh) titled Three-Hundred. (uhh) Three-Hundred (ehh) basically tells the story of an ancient Greece battle. (umm)  (uhh) One king and his three-hundred Spartans who (uhh) fought against Xerxes and his massive Persian army. (uhh) Basically (uhh) they face insurmountable odds and overcame (uhh) sorta this great battle. (umm) Basically this is from the same creator of Sin City and it has some of that same feel to it. (umm) This movie was shot in (uhh) sixty days I read (umm) but actually took an entire year later of (uhh) doing special effects editing. So that's just kind of crazy, it gives you an idea of some of the like (umm)  fictional elements involved in this story. (umm) Basically the movie is superbly acted, (uhh) the action is incredible, (umm)  the drama and adaptation of war are (uhh) very realistic and I think that (uhh) this is a combination of sort of the old (umm) Braveheart (uhh) mixed with some of the new (uhh)  kind of like (uhh)  incredible (uhh) animation and (uhh) just kind of crazy lighting effects that you can expect from the director of Sin City. (umm) So I think if you're looking for a good action adventure (uhh) war type drama movie I would check out Three-Hundred.	3.559
Hi. Today I'm going to be reviewing the movie Best Laid Plans. It stars Reese Witherspoon. (umm) Relationships can be murder. (umm) It's the special edition. (uhh) It's rated R and (umm) {mumble} one and a half hours long.   (umm) The movie is about (umm) a guy (umm) who (umm) owes some money and (umm) he (umm) ends up robbing and it go, ends up being bad. (umm) And so he's left (umm) owing this guy money in, like, 48 hours or he's going to die. And since his robbery went bad (umm) he takes what the movie says, desperate measures to (umm) well, undertakes drastic measures to get his hands on some fast cash.  But (umm) he works with his girlfriend, who is Reese Witherspoon (umm) to (umm) get some cash quick to pay of his (umm) debt. (umm) It has some bonus features (umm) some deleted scenes, alternate endings, cast and crew bios, and other stuff like that.  (umm) But as for the movie itself, (umm) I didn't really care for it. (umm) My husband liked it, but (umm) I thought it was pretty boring. (umm) That's it. I just didn't care for it. It's kind of like a, it's a (stutter) drama movie, action. And usually I like Reese Witherspoon movie so I don't know what happened with this one but I didn't really like it so.	1.732
This is the Silence of the Lambs DVD. (uhh)  This (uhh) stars Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. (uhh) They both give (uhh) really good performances in the movie. (uhh) They both (uhh)   (uhh)   won Oscars for their roles. (umm)  Jodie Foster plays an FBI agent (uhh)   who is (uhh) trying to (uhh) (uhh) find a psychopathic serial killer who is (uhh) killing women and (uhh) she goes to (uhh) Anthony Hopkins' character in the movie (uhh) who is a a (stutter) cannibalistic (uhh) murderer himself (uhh) but he is in prison and she she (stutter) goes to him (uhh) to try to get clues on (uhh) finding (uhh) the other serial killer. (uhh) It's a It's a (stutter) great movie. This is the special edition widescreen version.  It contains brand new inside the labyrinth documentary including all new interviews with cast featuring (stutter) Anthony Hopkins, Jodie Foster and more. There's twenty minutes of deleted scenes.   (uhh)   There's the (uhh) original nineteen-ninety-one (uhh) making of featurette,  (umm)  Anthony Hopkins phone message, never before seen outtake reels, a photo gallery, a collectors booklet, and a teasers, trailers TV spots and more. (uhh)   So (uhh)  If you haven't ever seen the movie or even if you have, I I (stutter) would get the movie (uhh) just for the (uhh) special features on the special edition (uhh) because it's got a lot of good extra features. So, I would suggest purchasing the Silence of the Lambs DVD Special Edition version.	3.559
Right here with me right now I have this (uhh) movie called Aeon Flux. (uhh)   This is basically a very, very (uhh)   high action, action packed sort of like The Matrix kind of movie.   (uhh) It's where this girl here (uhh)   she goes around and she's trying to overthrow   the government or {cough} or the society   that she lives in,   in which, it everything is perfect, everything is run (uhh) perfectly.   Which is really, really like a stifling (stutter) claustrophobic feeling it gives you.   And (uhh)   she uses all a acrobatic fighting moves and everything to   overthrow this government. (uhh)   I think it's really interesting, it's really cool to see   (uhh) all these movies and everything.   (uhh) Sort of like The Matrix was at first. However,   just as The Matrix more matrixes came out it kinda got boring, kinda got old.   (uhh) This movie towards the end it kind of gets a little bit old. (uhh)   All the moves and everything like that, so   (uhh) though it's a good action thing it's not, doesn't have an amazing story   and it's a lot of (uhh) just the action and (uhh)   if you're into that sort of thing I would recommend getting this but if you're looking for something deeper I wouldn't suggest getting this movie.	5.354
Hey, how's it going? Today I'd like to talk to you about a certain movie that I saw a couple of weeks ago. I'm pretty sure you might have heard of it due to the controversy that it stirred in recent times, and it is called Three-Hundred. Three-Hundred is the story of this  Spartan king, (umm) Leonidas, who faces the  (stutter) oncoming onslaught of the Persian army led by Xerxes.   What he can either do is surrender his land to Xerxes and become a warlord of the entire like Grecian territory, or he can like stand up and fight him. Naturally (umm) Leonidas, the king of Sparta, who were known for their warrior skills like wants to fight him and then he ends up at what this movie talks about is the battle scene that ensues between them. The specific battle is the battle of (umm) Thermopylae I believe, and basically  the (stutter) the my favorite parts of it were the actual battle scenes because if you've seen the battle scenes from The Lord of the Rings you know how like hardcore those are, and this is like basically that Lord of the Rings except pretty much all battle scenes. So that was really cool. Some people were complaining about the  fact that there wasn't that much plot in it. Personally that wasn't a factor for me because I wasn't really looking for really (uhh) in depth character (umm) analysis and really three dimensional characters. I was looking for really amazing graphics that   had a like a lot of a (stutter) like glorious battle scenes and that definitely did have that. And you can tell like a lot of the things were green screen and, I mean,   it just looked really cool, it's a really cool movie experience. Been in the war kind of genre. It's kind of bloody so if you're not interested in that I wouldn't recommend that but it was a great movie and (umm)  yeah. (uhh) Some controversy that I xxx is with the (uhh) Iranians and the fact that they portray (umm) Persians in a negative light, because Iranians are very proud of their Persian culture and they didn't feel that (umm)  Three-Hundred was making a good portrayal of them, and I suppose this is kind of true but it it (stutter) is also just a movie so if you don't think you'll be offended by anything like that then I could definitely recommend checking that out. (uhh) It's a great movie. Wouldn't recommend bringing kids. It's a lot of fun and (uhh) if you watch it I hope you enjoy it.	6.351
This is one my favorite movies, it's A League of Their Own. It's got a lot of  stars, and it's kind of old, so I think this was,   well yeah they they (stutter) were stars then too. It's got like Tom Hanks, Geena Davis, and Madonna and (umm) and it's based on a true story from during world war two when the men went off to fight wars, and they needed women to play in major league baseball so that (umm) there would still be games going on. And (uhh) there's these sisters who love each other, but one is a little better player than the other, and it's really funny and it's really sweet. And I know this guy who's pretty tough and he does not cry in movies, he's only cried in one movie, and it was A League of Their Own {laugh}. It's a really sweet movie. (umm)  It's got this sticker on it because we got robbed and {laugh} the robber sold all our DVDs to a used shop so a lot of DVDs are marked, but (umm) a few got  bought before we got to the shop. I'm really glad they didn't buy this one because one of my favorites. I love this movie. It's sweet   (umm) and it's historical.	6.055
This is one of my favorite movies ever. You know around Christmas time, there are already a lot of classics out there like The Christmas Story, It's A Wonderful Life, White Christmas and they hadn't made a lot of good Christmas movies in a long time, like ones that would become classics, except this one.  This one was just made and it's definitely  gonna become a classic. It is so funny.  It has Will Ferrell in it and it is so funny, even for adults and for kids. But it's not, it doesn't have anything raunchy and it's not terribly slackening either so everyone.   I've not found a single person who's watched this movie that doesn't like it.  (umm) Will Ferrell is this elf who thinks he's an elf cause he's adopted into the elf world but he's actually a normal human.   And he ventures to New York but he's totally sheltered and loves Christmas and everyone's so hardened  and (umm) well kind of predictably brings the spirit of Christmas to them. But it's so funny and  like there's a department store Santa and of course he's not the real Santa and  (umm) Buddy knows the real Santa and he says, you're sitting on a throne of lies, and he gets really upset, it's great.	6.055
This might be the  most underappreciated Disney movie ever created.   Ever.   (umm) it's an awesome movie but it flopped in the box offices, but (stutter)  it killed during (umm)   when they were in video and DVD sales. It's awesome.  This is Newsies, and it stars Christian Bale when he was like  fifteen. He's amazing singer, dancer, actor.   Even though he's got a British accent in real life, he has a New York accent in this movie.  There's the kid from Doogie Howser, Doogie's friend in here who, he's an amazing tap dancer, who would have guessed?  It's a musical and it's based on a true story from (umm)   ninteen-o-one, nineteen-hundred kind of times in New York when there were orphaned boys who would sell newspapers.  From (umm) for  The World and The Journal.   And (umm) they were trying, the newspaper was trying to make more money, so they were gouging the paperboys.   And they have no leader, no union, but they organize and rebelled and they   (umm) and they united and it's really sweet, there's amazing choreography,   especially since they're just young boys, you don't expect them to be good dancers.	6.403
This is a video review for the  DVD movie Crimson Tide.   The,   this version is widescreen and the rating on it is rated R,  it's got a lot of bad language in it.   The genre is like an action thriller  and the length of the movie  is, where does it say, a hundred and sixteen minutes.   This movie, what this movie is about is it's got Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman, two of my favorite actors in this movie. It's about (uhh) a old   guy that's in the,   in the (stutter) (uhh) army which is Gene Hackman, or in the navy, and a new guy coming in Denzel Washington they're,   they're (stutter) both on the submarine and they both have conflicting orders that come through and they can't read them, so they both take a stand on what they think they say, and there's a big argument. Lot of drama in it, and  it's leading up to world war, possible world war three in it and  it's a really good,   it's a really good (stutter) drama movie. Action drama. So anyway I highly recommend this movie. I won't say too much about it cause I don't want to give it away. Anyway, that's my video review for Crimson Tide.	4.082
This is video review for Flash Gordon.  This movie is, this is the widescreen version.  (uhh) The rating   is PG.  The genre is (uhh)  is action sci-fi kinda.  And the length of the movie is one-hundred-eleven minutes.   This movie is about a, (uhh) is about a (stutter) guy,   that is a football player for the New York Jets, star quarter back.   And he's,   he gets on a plane   and he gets interviewed (stutter) he is getting fixed to get interviewed by,  some woman and then all of the sudden,   some   (stutter) aliens   start taking over the planet and they transport their airplane  to the, to the (stutter) other planet.   And so   they're they're (stutter) on that other planet   and it's all about them trying to get off.   There, a scientist gets on with them too.   You'll see how if you, if you (stutter) watch it,   but a scientist gets on with them.   And so it's the three of them that get on that new planet   and they don't know what to do.   And it's all about them trying to escape.   And (uhh) it's a really good movie,   it's one of my, it's a older movie,   but (uhh) it's it's (stutter) a good movie and I'd recommend it.  And that's my video review Flash Gordon.	3.317
This is (umm) The Python, the movie The Python   and (uhh) it's a story about (umm) a doctor, really like a mad scientist, who (umm)  develops (uhh) the perfect killing machine and it's (uhh) a python.   Engineered the perfect killing machine, the world's first massive genetically enhanced python,  and the actors are, let's see  (uhh) Jerry McCarthy, Will Wheaton, (uhh) Frayne Rosanoff, Casper (stutter) Van Dien, and Robert Englund.  Anyway (umm)  if you like snake movies then you'll this. If you like the Anaconda and all those other snake movies you'll like this. If you don't like snakes, you will not like this.  And (uhh) let's see.  this particular DVD  has outtakes, (uhh) still gallery on pythons,   (uhh) biographies on the cast and director, trailers,  (uhh) the  the English  and Spanish  subtitles,  so (umm), you know I didn't care for it. I mean I don't know if you can see the picture on this but (stutter) that python's got some huge fangs and (umm)  so if you like snake movies, you would like this. If not, I'd skip this.   Oh, you can get this at Amazon dot com or rent it from (umm)  Blockbuster. I think it sells for probably under ten dollars at Amazon dot com.	3.367
This is the   DVD Mars   (uhh) it stars Olivier Gruner   and Shari Belafonte.   You've heard of Shari Belafonte but that's probably the only person you've ever heard of.   The premise of it is that there is a (uhh)   mining company on Mars and they pretty much (uhh)   rule Mars   (uhh) what they say goes   (uhh) Olivier Gruner is a   he's some xxx (uhh)   signaled by his brother that he needs to come to Mars to help out   cause he's in trouble (uhh)   that's pretty much where this  this movie goes. This is what I would consider I guess a B B (stutter) movie, it's not, you know, it's not a top notch movie by no means.   (uhh)   Like I said, I don't know what else to say about it other than   if you really like B movies,   then you might like this one.   But if you're looking for one that has any kind of (uhh) story line, substances (uhh),   actors in it or whatever,  (uhh) I don't think this is the movie that you, you know, you want to go rent.	5.26
Saving Private Ryan.   This movie rules. (umm)   It's won so many awards, it was the best grossing (uhh) highest actually, highest grossing film of ninety-eight.   (uhh) It's two hours and forty-nine minutes long,   and (uhh) it's pretty much on every top hundred list   in the world for movies. (umm)   Steven Spielberg won a ton of like, (uhh) highest honors from the army and stuff like that too, that that's (stutter) how good this movie was, like it was very realistic and it told from the perspective of a soldier. So   it starts off   (umm) with the invasion of Normandy.   And the problem is   (umm) Private Ryan has three brothers in the war as well   and they all die. And so   Tom Hanks is the main character and his goal to the entire thing is to find Private Ryan and bring him back to his mom so that she doesn't lose four sons.   (umm) And they, and (stutter) embark on the epic journey where they're trying to decide   why are we trying to save this one guy, it's it's (stutter) a war, like people die.   Why are we saving one guy and there's eight of us risking our lives for this one guy.   And so the whole story takes place them trying to decide that for themselves as they go and find him.   And Matt Damon plays Private Ryan. And (uhh) overall I'd say it's a great movie, it definitely entertaining   even though it's long.   It, you won't, you won't (stutter) fall asleep in this one.   Check it out, Saving Private Ryan.	6.0
Wanted to review this movie Washington Square. (uhh) It stars (uhh) Ben Chaplin and Jennifer Leigh. And it's a story that takes place in the eighteen hundreds in New York. And you have an (uhh),  let's see upper class (umm) doctor  and (uhh) and his homely daughter  and (uhh) (stutter) you have this charming (uhh)  guy that comes along, played by Ben Chapling, Chaplin, who is (umm)   you don't know if he really loves the homely daughter or if he's out for her money and so that's the plot of the story.  And (umm)  it's really a boring story. I think the story (stutter) I think the movie is like an hour and fifty-five minutes but the whole, the whole time (stutter) you're waiting to, and you're waiting (stutter) and thinking that something's going to happen that's going to make the show interesting and before you know it the show is over with and that exciting thing never did happen. So (umm), you know, I found it boring and I would probably give it, you know, maybe a three out of five rating.   (uhh) But you can get, you know, you can get Washington Square at Amazon dot com or you can borrow it and rent it. Some people may like it because (umm)  it's in the eighteen-hundreds, maybe mid eighteen-hundreds to late eighteen-hundreds and so (umm) it's interesting watching the social life of that era. That was, that was (stutter) really interesting. And so   for that reason some some (stutter) people may to want to watch it just to see the,   you know, the social life of that era. But other than that I really didn't care for it. I thought it was boring and it, the movie is called Washington Square with (uhh) Jennifer Leigh and Ben (stutter) Chaplin.	3.367
Hi, my name's Rob, I'm reviewing the movie Serenity   on DVD.  This is a movie that's   a spinoff of the   series Firefly that was cancelled on Fox.  (umm) The story is five-hundred years into the future   where a   gang of,   I guess you could call them pirates,   are battling the evil alliance   that has control of the universe.  It stars Nathan Fillion,   Adam Baldwin and   (stutter) Summer Glau.  Let's see the feature,   the special features include twenty minutes of deleted scenes,   outtakes,   and a documentary called Relighting the Firefly.   It's the story of how (stutter) the television show   had such a following that   it became a   (umm) motion picture.   It's rated PG-thirteen. Thanks for watching my review.	1.414
I am doing a review of the movie Hot Fuzz, which is out in theaters now.  Hot Fuzz was the most refreshing and delightful movie I have seen in quite some time.   It had me chuckling from start to finish. {laughs}  In fact the whole theater, when I was there, was laughing (stutter) almost the entire time.  (umm) So if you're a fan of Shawn of the Dead, you will love this movie.  And the original British Office or (uhh) the British comedy Extras, you will too love this movie.  (uhh) The movie started off kind of slow, the long introduction that I could of have been half as long. But once the movie got going, it was excellent and fast paced and funny. Parodies of American cop movies popped up throughout the film.   The main character, Sergeant Nicholas Angel, played by Shaun of the Dead's Simon Pegg,   he outshines all of the  London's police academy. Because of this, they transfer him to the small town of Sanford. Hilarity ensues.  See the movie, you won't regret it. You will not regret it. It's very good. When I went there, the entire theater was laughing. It's really delightful,   funny movie unlike all the other movies you've seen.  (uhh) I also enjoyed how in the cop scenes or in the  scenes where they're fighting, no one actually gets killed. They just get like  hurt a little bit and all captured and put in prison. So that was a nice refreshing change. So see the movie.	4.082
I will now be reviewing Aqua Teen Hunger Force   Colon Movie For Theaters.   (umm)  Let me first off start by saying that I absolutely hate the   show Aqua Teen.   I think it's   horrible.  I've never been able to watch a full episode, when I do   I'm just kind of like   (uhh)   that's what I'm like.   So I didn't want to go to see this movie but somebody paid for my movie ticket, so I went.   And I expected to fall asleep but   I did not.   The beginning of the movie starts out with this little dancing, these little dancing (stutter) food people.   And that part was probably the most hilarious part of the movie. In my opinion.   So if anything go to see that.   If you like the show you'll like the movie.   If you don't like the show,   you will not like this movie but you won't dislike it as much as you like the show.   I could have   about halfway in the movie it's like I,   I (stutter) think I'd seen enough.   {noise} I wanted to leave.   Whoops sorry. I wanted to leave but I couldn't because I was there with a friend and she would not leave   and she paid for my ticket so how could I really leave.   (umm)   I really have no further comment on this movie because I zoned out for most of it.   So I would just say that (uhh)   do not   see it   {laugh} if you don't like the show.   That's my, my (stutter) advice for you guys.   If you like the show see it though.   And that is all, bye.	4.0
Hi. This is Dan with my review of Groundhog Day by (stutter) Bill Murray. This is one of my favorite movies. So I would give this a (stutter) enthusiastic five out of five rating. (umm) Groundhog Day is rated PG for (umm) some suggestive scenes and materials, but this is a very funny movie in that it is well-played by Bill Murray and well-written (umm) by far. Groundhog Day (umm) being (ahh) that day in spring in which the groundhog comes out of its hibernation, checks and looks for its shadow. And if he sees it, then we have X more weeks of winter left, something like that.  (umm) Billy Murray and his crew, his news crew, are sent to cover (umm) the (umm) emergence of Punxsutawney Phil, yup, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, (uhh) the (stutter) groundhog famous for coming out and looking for its shadow. But what Bill Murray finds out is that he is somehow trapped in this day. He wakes up. He replays the day over, as if nothing the day before had happened. And, you know, he lives this day over and over and over again. At first, he enjoys it, from robbing banks to doing whatever he wishes, (uhh) until he finally realizes that he's stuck in this little timewarp and even tries to drive off a cliff to kill himself, only to wake up to that same alarm that's been going off day after day after day. The mystery is how he is going to break out of this loop, and that's the fun of the movie.   Groundhog Day is a fun one, good for dates, good for significant others. It's, to some degree, a chick flick (uhh) which is, which is (stutter) fun. But you'll also get a good laugh out of it (umm) in addition to the romance and the drama that does evolve in it.  This is Dan and my hearty recommendation of Groundhog Day as a movie not to be missed.	6.683
In theaters now, better check it out before it leaves, is the movie called The Host.   It is about a creature   a sea monster that develops after some chemicals are poured down the drain   and it attacks people, kills them and brings them to its secret lair.   And there is a family, a father,   a (uhh) grandfather, and an aunt and uncle I believe,   who are all trying to (uhh) find the   a young girl who the sea monster has captured and she gives them the call to let them know she's still alive.   So that whole movie is the adventure of finding the girl, and nobody believes that she's actually alive,   so they are on the run. They had to sneak out because they thought they were   (umm) they were quarantined,   big thing. Anyway   lots of adventure.   Fun movie, not the usual thing.   I, it is, (stutter) it does have subtitles so if that's not your thing   there's your warning. But   (umm) it's a kind of   thing where once you're watching the movie you forget you're even reading the subtitles.   But anyway I really enjoyed it and I recommend you go see it.   Also it's pretty long, so   you might want to keep that in mind.   But very long. I liked it.	4.243
This is a fantasy story  that has been collected into one collection here for us  thanks to (umm) Bandai's (uhh) cheap releases and the anime anime (stutter) legends collection we get the Scrapped Princess.   This is about Pacifica Cassul, she's right here, she's a girl with a destiny  and it is rumored that she is called the scrapped princess.   A girl,   who according to prophecy, is going to destroy the world. How she will destroy the world? Why she will destroy the world? She doesn't know, she's simply a sixteen year old girl that  loves her (umm) brother and sister who basically adopted her because she doesn't know her parents and (uhh)   they travel trying to (uhh) escape these rumors that keep following them and people want to kill her and no one really seems to know why.  It's just a legend that the scrapped princess will make the (uhh) world come to an end and she's apparently the chosen one and she doesn't know why.   So,   that's basically the basis of the whole story and it's a fast xxx one as events become to unfurrow and pieces of the puzzle start to come together.   (umm) It's beautifully animated. (umhh) The animations are absolutely gorgeous and the English sub is surprisingly good too.  (umm) You do get the (uhh) English subs and the (umm) Japanese (uhh) original language with the English subtitles.   (uhh) You get a few extras (uhh) not much it's just the textless opening and textless ending  for those of you who like to watch those and (uhh) it's just presented in here in a way in a way that was originally released. You get all the discs.   I do not believe they have been altered in anyway. They look the same on the first on the first four individual volumes before getting this collection and the discs look exactly the same so I don't really think Bandai did much other then just repackage it in this great collection for it to be cheaper so  this is Scrapped Princess. The MSRP is about thirty-nine ninety-nine and can be found much cheaper online because it is a wonderful story   especially for people looking for (umm)   an anime with some fantasy to it.   It doesn't seem to be a lot out there these days. This one definitely has a fantasy twist and some really great memorable characters and I will mention that (uhh)   Christian Freeman does the voice of her brother, Shannon and he is fantastic in the role.   He's he's (stutter) terrific so if you're a Christian fan, if you're following him, you definitely need to pick this up. And (uhh) even if you're just looking for a great anime with a great story,   Scrapped Princess has it for you.   I give it a five out of five stars.	2.944
This is the platinum edition of Aladdin,   (umm) one of Walt Disney's movies that came out in nineteen ninety two.   This version came out a few years ago though.  (umm) Aladdin is a story about this guy, Aladdin, who lives in Agrabah and  (umm) he is very poor. He pretty much has to steal to live. He always dreams about living in the palace and one day he's in the marketplace and he meets Princess Jasmine, who has run away, and   (umm) he doesn't know she's the princess but eventually he finds out and  (umm) he also comes across a magic lamp which helps him become a prince  (umm) and therefore he can see Jasmine more and it's just really sweet story about him and Jasmine.  (umm) This version has a lot of backstage (umm) features.  (umm) It actually shows you that before (umm) the final copy, they were gonna have Aladdin having a mom but, and they were gonna have a whole song with Aladdin and his mom called "Proud of Your Boy", but in the end, they completely took the mom out of the story. So it has cool stuff like that. So Aladdin is a great movie.	3.416
{noise}  Hello I am Jenny and I am here to tell about You Got Served.  It's a dancing video.  I don't think it's that good   it's a special edition   and it's ninety-five minutes long,  not really worth the ninety-five minutes as Kevin xxx in it xxx    and (uhh)   I don't know, they dance all wacky, they pretty good I mean, if I can dance like that,  I want to be in a movie  but it's about hip hop dancing and their stomp I guess and it has special features  and {sigh} the making of you got served feature and it has preview on it too but, I don't know why they put a preview on a DVD but, they did.  It has subtitles in English and French   and it also has   not one comedian on it xxx I can't find it but, it has comedian on it but xxx pretty funny on TV a lot.  It has scantly dressed women which men might like so,  anyways you can watch it but I really xxx.	5.26
Hi (umm) today the product that I'm going to review is   a DVD.   It's called I Love You... Don't Touch Me! (umm)   This is   a story about   a   young woman   (umm)   is probably based in the 1990s or something.   But it's a story of a young woman   (uhh) who's twenty-five who   is (umm)   basically in love with love and she's trying to find mister right.   But (umm)   it's kind of a   boring movie.   (umm)   I just watched it to find out if she happens to get together   with her (umm) best friend,   who is who is (stutter) a guy (umm) who's in love with her.   But she has   (umm) no feelings for him, no feelings of love for him in the beginning.   And she (umm)   the story focuses a lot on   (umm)   intimacies. {laughter} Between   men and women. (umm) A little bit too much.   She uses,   is a lot of foul language in this movie.   (umm) Even though it's   (umm)   PG-thirteen. I   don't like it.   (umm) If you'd like to   watch this movie or   you wanna own the movie you can find it on amazon dot com or on (stutter) DVD discounts for under twenty dollars.	1.915
Marlin Brando is thought by some to be the greatest actor of all time.  However, (uhh) that can definitely be challenged by some of the roles he's taken.  (umm) When I first saw his appearance in this movie those are exactly the words I thought to myself Was this is the greatest actor of all time?  The movie I'm speaking of is The Island of Doctor Moreau.  Marlin Brando plays a  somewhat mad scientist  (uhh) who is not bent on world domination, just his genetic experiments where he combines humans and animals.  (uhh) It was also starring Val Kilmer as his crazy veterinarian assistant who (uhh)  does not have the scientist part down but he does have the mad part down.  {clears throat} The story is a man is picked up after (uhh) his boat goes down and (uhh)  gets taken to the island of Doctor Moreau where he falls in love with one of his experiments, who he claims is his daughter.  (uhh) (uhh) Anarchy breaks loose and its supposed to be (uhh)  viewing the (uhh),  I guess the uncontrollability of man, that no society can be perfect.  The acting in it is comical as opposed to serious, so if you're looking for a movie that you can take seriously do not get it.  I personally had a lot of fun making fun of it while watching it.	4.509
Directed by Ron Howard, Backdraft stars (uhh) Kurt Russel and William Baldwin as two Chicago Firefighters out to stop an arsonist.  (umm) Has a good strong supporting cast including Donald Sutherland and Robert De Niro.   However, It's aged quite a bit and for a murder, thriller, drama starring firefighters it's not all that great of a movie.   (umm) For one thing it has William Baldwin, one of the worst of the Baldwin brothers. (umm)  In it's some interesting use of fire, particularly the whole concept of back draft, which a lot of people don't really know about. (umm)  Starts in Chicago which is my favorite city, which gotta give props for that, that they don't use New York or Los Angeles. Go for something a little grittier, get the (uhh) audience. Of course it's filmed in the nineties otherwise they would've probably used New York for the firefighters.  (umm) The movie has very few (uhh) additional features on it. (umm) just captions and subtitles. It's widescreen,   yes widescreen see.   If you get this for five bucks, I guess it would be okay to get.   (umm) It's really not worth watching though.   Directed by Ron Howard and he does a good job usually, but not with this. This is a bad movie.	3.786
This is White Chicks with the Wayans brothers.   I think this movie is hilarious, like I've seen it so many times and every time I still think it's so funny.  (umm) Basically it's about these two guys who are FBI agents and the movie starts off with them trying to bust a drug deal but they catch the wrong guys and get in a lot of trouble basically. So they're trying to get back into their boss's, (umm) the chiefs, good graces.  And (umm) okay their boss says, okay you guys   gotta just pick up these girls from the airport, these two white girls and just drive em back to the hotel.   So, they do it, but on the way back to the hotel there's a little car accident   and one of the girls ends up with a scratched up nose and one of them ends up with a busted lip and   (umm) they were supposed to, the girls were supposed to go to this party the next day   but they freak out and it's just really funny cause  they're these really rich valley girls and these little scratches are such a big deal to them  and so they refuse to go to the party.  So these guys know they have to do something, so they dress up as the girls and go to the party as them.  And (umm) there are just so many moments that are hilarious in it. So I would definitely recommend it.	5.354
This is volume three of Paradise Kiss.   xxx And (uhh) this was a wonderful anime series.   And (umm)   just to give you   an update cuz I'm sure if you're interested in volume three you've probably seen one and two as well.   And (umm)   even if you were stalling at the end of two and willing to go ahead and finish it off   definitely need to see how this ends cuz it is very intriguing series.   Paradise Kids is about (uhh)   this group of (umm) motley teenagers   (umm) from high school and they are starting a   (umm) designer label they want to make clothes.   And (umm)   you get a very varied (umm) group of people there is a punk rocker and his girlfriend   who is very (umm) girlish but (umm) her sister   actually runs (uhh) a major fashion label.   Then of course there's George who becomes one of the   main characters and   (uhh)   the seducer of Yukari.  And Yukari is the main character and she kind of falls in with these people   as they had spot her on the street and decide that she should be the model for their clothes.   And she has never really thought about doing anything like that before.   It's never occurred to her.   A lot of thing in her life has been studying and trying to   achieve going to college which is what her mother wished for her.   But (uhh)   and when she meets people of paradise kiss,   (uhh) things begin to change, she gets wrapped up in romance and different friendships.   And (uhh) her whole world goes topsy turvy and (uhh)   she starts making decisions for her own whether they're for her own good or not.   And (uhh) this continues that you'll see her progress as being   just (uhh) a very lame   girl.  That (uhh)   just studies all the time very studious into becoming a model because the transformation really happened here.   And also the direction and the lives  of these characters that you've been following  from the previous two volumes.  Now if you haven't seen the anime before,  it's very beautifully done and very unique  style. Is (uhh)  very lean looking characters  and is done by the (uhh)  character designer for xxx  one thing that's very noticeable is that the  facial expressions in anime are usually just lip flaps  and some occasional eye movements and  these characters are very expressive in the face. So you're really pulled into their emotions because of that.  It also has a very good opening and ending song.  And (uhh) the colors in this anime are very dark.  Kind of dark hued it gives it kind of a forboding  mysterious feel, lots of golds,  deep purples, dark blues.  And it it (stutter) really helps color this world (uhh) a little darker   than you normally see. It's a very serious story,   is not slapstick it's not humor.   It's all drama and it's all very realistic.  So if that's what you're looking for in anime  Paradise Kiss is gonna deliver it for you.  This is volume three  and retails for about twenty-four ninety-five.  It is an excellent anime to add to your collection.  I highly recommend it, it's one of my favorites and I would give it five out of five stars for Paradise Kiss.	5.802
Hi, I'm gonna review a movie in theaters now and this movie's called Knocked Up and it stars Katherine Heigl and some other (uhh) cast members and I was really disappointed with the with the (stutter) movie and felt you know, I got short changed. I wanted to go back to the manager and ask for my money back  (uhh) cause this movie is really bad. Now it is rated R for sexual content and language and drugs and it had all three of those and  the drugs it had too much and just totally unnecessary.  (uhh)   (uhh) shots about drugs or scenes with drugs in it   and the language in it was horrible. It was bad. (uhh) Really gross language.  So you definitely don't wanna take your children to this movie.  In fact I wouldn't wouldn't (stutter) recommend the movie to anybody unless you're over a hundred. (uhh) Even then  (uhh) It's probably not a good movie to watch.  But I was totally   (uhh) totally (uhh) turned off by the movie and  you notice that, or we notice that in the trailers that they put out on the movie, you know they only showed the funny shots. Had they put out the bad language shot, I don't think as many people would go to see the movie.   But (stutters) Katherine was the only   (umm) actress in there that did a credible job of acting. All of the other actors were terrible.   (uhh) They just weren't good actors. The script was bad and it's just totally a gross movie. I wouldn't recommend it.  (uhh)   (uhh) Wouldn't recommend this movie to anybody.  In fact (uhh) I would give it an award. It was, this is the worse movie in ten years award is what I would give the movie.  (uhh) So again, the movie is Knocked Up. Don't go see it, it's bad.	4.243
Hey, take it easy.  This is Nacho Libre  starring one Jack Black and a pair of tights.   (uhh) The story's about Jack Black,  that guy right there.  He works in a   (uhh) monastery. I'm not sure the technical term but he's he's a (stutter) practically a priest. By night he raises money by fighting as a, a (stutter) luchador.  Which is a   hispanic wrestler.  Now I'm not a human, Spanish, luchador, wrestling dictionary but I'm, that's pretty sure what I mean, what it means.  (umm) The comedy leaves you wanting a little more. It's kinda weird, it's you wanna laugh but you don't.  There's some good parts. Jack Black has a mustache.   Personally I gave it one and a half stars out of five. (uhh) It looks nice.  The comedy's in the same vein I'd say, as the director's previous film Napoleon Dynamite but it's just not all there unfortunately.   Which is kinda sad cause I was really hyped up about this movie. I didn't watch it until I bought it.   But otherwise, it's worth at least a rental.	3.873
Hi. Today with me I have the video Lady (uhh) Disney's Lady and the Tramp Two Scamp's Adventure.  (umm) This is rated G and runs for about seventy minutes.  The impeccable pedigree of Disney's beloved classic Lady and the Tramp comes in an all new story, Lady and the Tramp Two Scamp's Adventure. Told with the same stunning animation, charming musical style, and purebred fun.   Along with their well behaved girl puppies Lady and the Tramp are busy raising mischievous   Scamp who's always in the doghouse. Longing for freedom, Scamp ventures far from home and meets a lovely, reluctant stray named Angel.  She introduces him to the junkyard dogs led by streetwise Buster. When Buster challenges Scamp to the ultimate test of a carefree life Scamp finds himself torn between a world of adventure and love for the family he's left behind. All new music and star studded voice talent leaded by Scott Wolf and Alyssa Milano  (umm) makes this irresistible, heart warming tale a whole new breed of Disney magic.  I highly recommend this movie, it's so (umm)  cute. It's really touching {laugh} and (umm) I got this at Target for about (umm)   twelve dollars.   I highly recommend this.	2.16
I'll be reviewing the dvd of the work of director Michael Gondry. Now this is a (uhh)   much, pretty a series   (uhh) clearly focusing on (umm) a music video directors. (uhh) Well Gondry's one of the first one they did.   It was a really awesome choice (umm) he's one of my favorite directors just out, even outside of music videos. You know he's probably most notable for   (uhh) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was his you know, kind of debut (uhh) feature film.    This is just, if you liked that movie then you probably check up, definitely check this out even if you don't like the kind of music you know (uhh) he (uhh) he  directed for (uhh) the videos are amazing, just the, you know the level  of creativity   you know he shows you've seen it Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind you know exactly what I'm talking about this is kind of really out there.   You know, visual style while they're you know, animating videos with your stop motion legos.   Or (uhh) I I (stutter) really don't want to even really say that much you know it's it's (stutter) just awesome some of the things he does.   (umm) A lot of the music featured in this, it's a lot of techno (uhh) except maybe it's not quite so mainstream. He's done a lot of Bjork videos   (uhh) a number of (uhh) White Stripes,   (uhh) some Daft Punk, some Chemical Brothers (umm).   Music wise it's not super to my taste   (uhh) but just,   you know I do I do (stutter) enjoy a lot of it   (uhh) but just visually it's it's (stutter) worth owning. (umm) You know it also includes (uhh) a couple short films of his a couple stories, you know that kind of thing.   It's just really, really cool just to own if you're a, you know if you're a fan of his, you know of his direction you know since he broke into feature films just want to see kind of his older stuff you know or if kind of, you know, where he got his start.	5.066
This is Entrapment, and it stars, (umm) Sean Connery and Katherine Zeta-Jones.    This is the full-screen edition, (umm), it is rated PG-thirteen for (umm) probably some language and the action,   but (umm) it is about, this guy who is kind of this thief and when a (uhh) priceless Rembrandt is stolen in New York  (umm) Katherine works for this insurance company and she is the investigator, so she kind of teams up secretly with (umm) the thief  to try to, you know, I guess, you know, catch him and he doesn't know who she really is,   but she does, and so, they work together trying to find and, like, steal this next piece of art that is worth millions of dollars.  (umm) And it's a good movie.  It's really intense (umm) You have to follow it pretty closely, but it's good.   It's full of action and I mean, it has some bonus features also so that's always good but yeah, I recommend it.	4.243
There's some films that are really comical and just rather funny without meaning to be. One such film is Reign of Fire. This film {clears throat} is about a dragon even though there's about eight seconds total of dragon in the entire film. A dragon population that takes over the world. It's set in England (umm)  and it's mainly in a castle where a few survivors live and just scratch on day by day. They don't really live, it's just survive. (umm) {clears throat} The scene takes a twist with Matthew McConaughey,   I'm sorry, Matthew Slab of Beef McConaughey enters the (uhh) scene as a (uhh) US (uhh)  military man that is trying to combat the dragons. He's developed a plan to destroy them and he is relying on the inhabitants of the castle to help carry it out. {clears throat}  The acting is over the top, shoddy, hilariously done even though it's not meant to be. As far as a serious film? Do not rent this. But if you're looking for something to make fun of (uhh) I would definitely (umm)   definitely pick this up just to sit around and poke fun of. The best scene is when Matthew McConaughey's character finally speaks and you ask yourself "wow, you're really going with that character?" So (uhh)  view with discretion.	5.686
Hey expo tv I'm Dea and as a rule I love superhero movies, I've said that before.   (umm) I love everything about them, the cheese factor, the action sequences, the whole thing.   However there are  there are (stutter) some of, some exceptions to that rule. As to all rules.  (umm) One of the exceptions to my rule is Daredevil.  This is very likely one of the worst {laugh} movies of all time.  Okay, I'm not saying this out of hatred or to be stylish.  But Ben Affleck is seriously a black hole of talent.  Because no matter how many awesome people you put in a movie, Ben Affleck can suck any good out of it. It's true.  There are a couple movies that Ben Affleck is in that I I (stutter) actually like. And I don't personally, I don't have like a vendetta against him, I don't hate him or anything.  I, he's not one of those people like, if he's in a movie I refuse to watch it. There are a couple of those people.  But it just seems like anytime Ben Affleck's in a movie, it's just bad.  Anytime like post the nineties at least.  (umm) I mean a ton of really cool people are in here.  Jennifer Garner plays Elektra Nacho, or as we like to call her, electric nachos.  (umm) She, as cool as Jennifer Garner is, and as hot as she looks in all this leather,  she still cannot  fight the sucktasticism  that is Ben Affleck. It's sad. (umm)  Michael Clark Duncan is in here and we all know he's stone cold cool.  And so is Colin Farrell.  And like, I like Colin Farrell.  But this movie's just not good and I highly suspect that it's because of the Ben Affleck.  And his  black holeyness of talent.	7.0
Hi, I'm back  and I'm going to be giving a review of a movie I did not like,  Ocean's Twelve.   Now  I loved Ocean's Eleven, it was just a great movie and it had all these great actors in it and it was just a lot of fun,  but Ocean's Twelve seems like it was really stretching to you know, find a plot to find some action, just all around to find some entertainment. I just wouldn't recommend it. I mean it's got George Clooney, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Matt all those people.  (umm) But none of em were just very good in this movie. I mean, they they're (stutter) good actors, it's just a boring movie.   Now the plot of this movie  is that they  (umm) are actually I  believe in Europe. Yeah they're in, it's been awhile since I've seen it, they are in Europe and looking to find a safe and it just, you know I honestly don't even remember that much but I was just falling asleep during the movie, it just wasn't good.   Now  they seem to have   (uhh) redeemed themselves in Ocean's Thirteen, which is actually out in theaters right now. I just saw that and that's a fantastic movie. So don't write off the entire series just because this one movie is bad. But  it is.   If you haven't seen Ocean's Eleven, go see it. It's amazing.  Skip Ocean's Twelve, go see Ocean's Thirteen.   So, I would give this movie, a two out of five. It was just   it was just weak and it was not something that I really liked that much.  Yeah  alright, well, have a good night.  Goodbye.	5.686
This is Dustin and today I'm reviewing The Good Shepherd, with Robert De Niro, Matt Damon and Angelina Jolie.  It's a story about when the CIA basically came into effect and how it came into effect and some of the major events that led to this, mostly dealing with the Cuban missile crisis and the Cold War.  (umm) Basically in this movie Matt Damon is a CIA agent and   it goes through the effects that it has on his life of how secretive it is and everything and  (umm) having to keep the secrets even from his family and how this ruins his family life basically and   (umm) about how the US government is corrupt   (uhh) in a way and and (stutter) (uhh) interfere with other country's affairs and everything. Overall this movie wasn't very good. It lacked action.I mean it had a story but it was very   (uhh) drawn out. The movie is two hours and forty minutes.   (uhh) I would give it a two out of five.	4.243
Chris Tucker is known for his off the wall slapstick comedic performances. At the same time, Jackie Chan is known for his martial arts special effects action flicks. Combine the two and you get Rush Hour two, the sequel to the very popular Rush Hour one.   (uhh) In this the, (uhh)  Chris Tucker plays a policeman that goes to Hong Kong with his, (uhh) to meet up with his friend that he met in the first movie that's played by Jackie Chan, and together they uncover a crime ring,  beat the crap out of a whole bunch of people, and generally just do really dumb things. (umm)  {clears throat}  The acting in this one is not really acting so much as one person fights and beats the crap out of others, (umm)  the other star of the movie makes loud-mouth, (uhh) off-color remarks through the entire thing.  (umm)  It's supposed to be   hilariously funny,  it's unfortunately not. It's quite the opposite.  (uhh) There are a few (uhh) good moments in there,  (umm) however I really didn't, (uhh) really didn't enjoy the film all that much.  (umm)   If you're (uhh) a fan of action you're, you're (stutter) gonna be a little bit disappointed because it's overshadowed by Chris Tucker's obnoxious performance, so I wouldn't recommend this film.	6.055
Remember when Nicolas Cage actually took interesting roles instead of just cheesy action roles where he got to exhibit absolutely no character or acting ability whatsoever?   Yeah, I miss those days. The Wicker Man. A remake of a (uhh)  seventies (uhh) horror (uhh)  psychological thriller film  is no different from his other (uhh)  action films that he's done.   It's just not up to par. The story line in this film  falls flat. I found myself actually rooting for the character's demise. (umm)   It's more comical than serious. (uhh) The acting is about the same   {clears throat}  Nicolas Cage serves up a big, hammy helping of his  balding, cheesy smile and attempt at charisma. Doesn't work. (uhh)  The only thing that really was interesting about this movie was the setting. It's set in a (uhh)  small island off the coast of Oregon where a cult is (uhh)  set up to (uhh)  basically (uhh) (uhh) where Nicolas Cage goes to investigate a missing child.  {clears throat}  The scenes are really well done. The villages and the buildings have a very (uhh)  a very unique take on things and it's a really cool set. Other than that, horrible horrible movie.	5.686
Russell Crowe is a great actor. He,   hands down, is one of the best and so that's why I recommend watching Gladiator.   (uhh) It stars obviously Russell Crowe and interesting enough Joaquin Phoenix.   (umm) Both characters  put on an amazing show of (uhh) great acting and  it's set in the background in Rome (umm)   This movie is visually spectacular. I think Ridley Scott directs it. (uhh)  Ridley Scott has directed (uhh) Kingdom of Heaven and Blade Runner so he knows what he is doing.   This movie is surely breathtaking. There are some scenes   that are so visually stunning that they will make you want to rewind it just for the scenery   (umm)   Set this movie takes place   everywhere between Rome to the deserts of Africa   to the lands of Germ (stutter) Germany so if you want an adventure   that has action, (uhh)   drama, and love. Then you want this movie. (umm)   This movie doesn't glorify violence like three hundred.   It just makes it,   uses violence to  to (stutter) (uhh) make the most   largest effect on the viewer. (umm) It is rated R, it's about two hours long (uhh)   I personally bought my copy for about twelve dollars and I am not sad about it. It's definitely worth every penny.	5.066
Hi I'm Marshal Hammer and right now I want to share with you this film, I've got it on DVD. It probably cost me about ten to fifteen dollars. I bought it on half dot com. This is Bound uhh starring Jennifer Tilly, Gina Gershon, and Joe Pantoliano and Patoliano is incredible in this movie, I've never seen him play a part this well. (umm) This is really a kind of a thriller, it's (umm)  it's on the fence between  (umm) a gangster movie and a lesbian love story. (umm)  Bound keeps me in suspense every time I watched it and I've seen it about a million times now. Maybe that's an exaggeration. But I've I've (stutter) watched it a lot. I've definitely (umm) made it so this film has paid for itself over and over again. (umm) This isn't going to be a film that you can watch with your children, (umm) it's probably going to be something that you can watch on a date or (umm) with friends. And (umm) on the scale of one to ten. I'm sorry, on the scale of one to five I would give this a five. (umm) If it were a scale of one to ten I'd give it a ten {laugh} definitely. So check this out. Bound starring Jennifer Tilly, Gina Gershon, and Joe Pantoliano.	5.972
Hi Expo Tv. We have today   one of my favorite James Bond movies.   The Living Daylights.   Featuring Timothy Dalton   as   double oh seven, James Bond.   Well this is a very fast paced movie with plenty of action, suspense, gunfights,   horse chases, big machinery shooting at each other, airplanes.   It's got basically everything you could want in a James Bond movie.   Timothy Dalton is actually a pretty good James Bond character, he (uhh) fits the role well.   He (uhh) has a good (stutter) personality for it, he brings a lot of humor   to it. (uhh) He fits the role very well I liked him in it.   (uhh) This James Bond movie also has I think one of the best James Bond theme songs,   (uhh) called the living daylights of course  by a group I'd never heard of   and I'm pretty sure it's their only song.   But it's still a good song.   So if the song made the movie,   this is a five out of five.   But the song doesn't make the movie,   but it still gets five out of five   because it has good plot, good suspense, good action, humor, it's got it all.   Good James Bond.   Five out of five stars, both thumbs up.   Quality movie.	5.416
Hi. My name is Mary and today I'll be reviewing Evan Almighty, which is a movie that recently came out in movie theaters. And (umm) it's basically a sequel to Bruce Almighty. It's about this guy who, named Evan Baxter, who is newly elected to Congress, and he's a newscaster. And (umm) and he is next one that is anointed by God to (uhh) do a holy mission. So he leaves Buffalo behind and goes to (uhh) Virginia, where, with his family. And then there he gets the order from God to (umm) build an ark. So he has to go find animals. And his family is, like, incredibly confused. They don't know if he's having a midlife crisis or if he really is   (umm) you know, destined for (stutter) something great.  (umm) Honestly, oh, oh, yeah. And there's two different (umm) I mean, there's a bunch of different names for this movie. It's also known as Bruce Almighty two (umm) Bruce Almighty sequel, and The Passion of the Ark.   But, yeah, it's about ninety minutes long. So it's not very long at all. And, honestly, it was just, it's rated PG too, but, honestly, it really wasn't that good, {laugh} in my opinion. I didn't think Bruce Almighty was that good, and Evan Almighty is the same except a little bit worse. So I would not recommend it.  All right. Thanks.	3.559
Welcome back. This is Killfast37, and I'm reporting in once again.  Now, today's review is going to be about a terrible movie called House of the Dead. It's it's (stutter) a movie adaptation from the video game House of the Dead. It was very popular back in the arcades a few years ago. Now, Uwe Boll decided to make a movie about it. And the movie didn't turn out so great.  (umm) There are zombies that run and know Kung Fu. All the teenagers in the movie know how to use guns and all kinds of crazy stuff. And they all also know martial arts. There are random explosions, random gore, random violence, and random sex. It's extremely {sigh} it's hard to turn away. It's like a train wreck happening in slow motion. You want to look away, but you can't. That's how bad this movie is.  I mean, if you're a fan of zombies, don't even check it out. It's just going to make you upset, like it has me. I love zombies. House of the Dead is not a good movie. Stay far away from it and burn it in coals when you do see it.  It's an abomination to the film industry, and it's just, it's just (stutter) awful. Please avoid this movie at all costs.  House of the Dead, I give you one star. If I could give you less, I would. This is almost as bad as Manos Hands of Fake.  Well, that's all I've got to say about this movie because it's so terrible. I'll see you next time, hopefully, on a better review.	6.351
Hey   (uhh) This is a review of Pathfinder which   (umm) you've probably seen the trailer. It was   awesome, and   (uhh) very misleading. (uhh) You see the trailer was awesome but the movie   (umm) was terrible. It was   (uhh) it was terrible.   (umm) The story   was not   (uhh) not up to par and the acting was pretty lackluster.   (uhh) The CG, FX fight scenes all that,   they were good but it wasn't enough to save the movie at all.  (umm) But yeah it was, it was  (umm) pretty bad   show on their part.  (umm) I would avoid it.  It's   it's (stutter) not entertaining at all.   (umm) I'd give it a   (uhh) one out of five if I could.   I guess  probably closer to a zero, but I guess it rounds up. So yes,  terrible.	4.435
This is a review for the  movie   Meltdown   Days of Destruction starring Casper Van Dien. Meltdown Day of Destruction   is a movie with fine setting. The new releases   section at Blockbuster xxx directed the DVD movie. You know you're not going to get anything good when you rent it but,   it is starring I guess, nineteen ninety-eight xxx   Casper Van Dien   which I would say is only one of the good things about this film that is if you appreciate Casper Van Dien's acting at all and by acting I mean   his ability to portray Casper Van Dien. But anyway,   this film, the (stutter) plot primary consist of Caster Van Dien, like, good cop who   gets stuck in a really, really terrible situation i.e. you know,   the xxx destruction of the world and   with his   dysfunctional family he tries to make an escape towards the Arctic.   I'm not kidding, that's the (uhh) plot of this film.   One of the {sigh}   lacking aspects of this feature   along with   zero nudity,   zero violence,   zero vulgarity,   zero suspense,   terrible acting,   terrible dialogue,   mutants mutants (stutter) show up, they never explained how there are mutants I guess, the radiation from the sun or something like that xxx that's not important.   What's important is that you should never rent this film unless you have a depreciation in general for films which in that case,  go right ahead cause this is a terrible film.   Compared to other classic starring Casper Van Dien like Python or Tarzan,   this is, this is simply not   meet the expectation.   As for rating a   quantification, I would it's about a   one point five out of five stars and I don't know why I'm being so generous today but for whatever reason I am. But (umm)   so if you like horrible movies,   you have a secret crush on Casper Van Dien that you didn't get over in the nineties,   please rent Meltdown  Days of Destruction.	4.546
Hey. (uhh) This is a review for The Invisible which (umm)  {sigh} is currently in theaters, at least not to DVD yet. (umm) It is, it's it's (stutter) terrible. It's (umm)  a complete  (uhh) waste of time to watch. The story was (umm)   the (stutter) the outline or the (uhh) general theme of the movie was a pretty good one but (uhh) didn't really execute it very well. (umm)  {sigh} had some pretty annoying   scenes like where they  show him doing something and then it'd reverse and suddenly oh, he hadn't done it. (umm) Yeah clever the first time and then afterwards   it just gets (umm) tiring. (umm) But {sigh} some of the acting was good but others   terrible. (umm) Yeah I wouldn't recommend it, don't bother. I give it a two out of five.	4.69
Hi (uhh) this is a review of Next   which (uhh) stars Nicolas Cage, Julianne Moore, (uhh)   Jessica Biel all those guys. (uhh)   It's (uhh)   has a pretty cool premise   seeing in the future that sort of thing but (umm)   wasn't executed very well, it was (uhh)   pretty, pretty (stutter) poor movie. (umm)   Thought that (uhh)   could have been a lot better.   The acting (uhh) was {laughter}   pretty ridiculous at times   and   it's just.   It was, it was (stutter) a pretty boring movie.   I would definitely not watch it again.   (umm)   I don't recommend that you do, either.   (uhh)   Get anything else.   (uhh) It's boring.   It was nonsensical at times.   It's   not possible, (uhh) can't suspend beliefs that much.   (uhh) Two out of five.	3.742
Hi, I'm here to bring you a video review of yet another Quentin Tarantino film. Now this classic film is Pulp Fiction, starring John Travolta Samuel L. Jackson and it's just an amazing movie. You'll hear just so many pop culture references come from this movie. If you haven't seen it, you will be, watch it and you'll be amazed at all the stuff in pop culture you've been missing. People make references to it all the time.  Now the movie itself is kinda long. It's about a hundred and fifty-four minute. So don't watch it unless you have a nice chunk of time to sit down and really pay attention.   The movie itself, which also stars Bruce Willis by the way, (umm) has a lot of interweaving, and Ving Rhames can't forget him so cool, has a number of interweaving plot lines. So it's not just one story, it's the story of John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson interacting with Ving Rhames, who also interacts with Bruce Willis. But they're all completely separate stories. So it's just really cool to see them interweave and see them all tie together in the end to show that they're all interconnected. It's kind of like the modern Crash, if you will.  (umm) Now the movie's rated R, and it definitely deserves that R. It's a pretty intense film. So   (uhh) don't let your kids watch it. But if you're looking for a nice movie to   (uhh) you know, full of action and violence, hence the name Pulp Fiction,  (umm) check out Pulp Fiction, a film by Quentin Tarantino.	6.403
Hi {sigh}. Tonight I'm going to be reviewing a terrible movie called  Killer Klowns From Outer Space. Now this is pretty much,   I mean it's released by MGM but it was a very independent sort of movie. It was made by Orion Pictures Corporation. It's very short, only eighty-six minutes long. It's rated PG-thirteen and it is about killer clowns who   are from outer space and they land in a field near a small town and they proceed to take,   take (stutter) over. And the movie also follows a group of teenagers who set out to destroy the clowns and reclaim what's rightfully theirs, their hometown.   But, I mean, as you can probably expect with a movie titled Killer Klowns From Outer Space the movie is   just full of terrible acting and bad cinematography.  It's a fun concept but they just didn't really pull it off that well. So that I would just, I would give it a two out of five. It has some funny moments but overall it's just not that great. So (uhh)  if someone gives you the DVD watch it, but I wouldn't spend any money on it like I did. This was kind of a waste of money. That's all I have to say about that.	6.055
Hey guys what's up. Welcome to my video review of Saving Private Ryan.  (uhh) It's widescreen edition.  (umm) This includes, special features   (umm) like  messages from Steven Spielberg about the movie. You've got behind the scenes stuff. (umm) Has Tom Hanks in it. It's definitely a great movie. Action in it, war, it's git some funny parts in it too but I don't think it's classed by comedy.  (umm) It's rated R for restricted, so you gotta be seventeen or older to watch it, or buy it for that xxx, or matter.  (umm) Like I said, it's a great movie.  (umm) I recommend it to anyone who   likes Tom Hanks or   war movies, stuff like that.  (umm) I'll give it a five out of five stars.   (uhh) You can find it at Wal Mart, probably like five bucks now. If you wanna rent from Blockbuster, it's definitely worth the rent, or you know just buy it like I said at Wal Mart. It's worth that too. So   (umm) like I said, I'd recommend it to anyone who likes war or Tom Hanks or action movies.  (umm) Thanks for watching this video review.	3.873
Hey,   this is a review   of the movie Firehouse Dog   which is currently in theaters. (umm)   Yeah, it, it (stutter) shouldn't be. It's (uhh)   kind of a disgrace   to Hollywood.   To (umm)   the human race in general. It is a   horrible, horrible movie.   (umm) Don't waste your time.   If you want (umm)   something more exciting you could perhaps stare at a wall   or throw yourself down a flight of stairs.   Something to that effect it might (uhh)   might be a better use of your time. (uhh) The plot   runs weak.   The acting was horrible.   (umm) Yeah just a terrible movie all around I wish I had never seen it.   (umm)   You should buy a DVD just to destroy it, but (umm)   if you don't have that much money don't bother.   (umm) I don't. I'm not going to, screw that. (umm)   Yeah terrible movie.	4.83
Hi, today I'd like to review The Forgotten on DVD.  This is a thriller slash  sci-fi movie starring Julianne Moore  and it's about a woman whose son disappears one day   and   and   everyone claims that her son never even existed  but you know she knows in her heart that he did exist. But overall,   it's a pretty bad movie.  (umm) It's predictable, cliched, I mean Julianne Moore is a great actress and she's good in this but  I think she can definitely find better work.  (umm) So overall I don't really recommend the movie. The DVD has some good special features though like  deleted scenes, an alternate ending,  (umm) audio commentary,  making of documentaries  so there's some good stuff there but   the movie's too bad for me to recommend fully.  (umm) Except for maybe as just a really mindless diversion  like   a weekend evening or something.  Okay, and that's my review of The Forgotten on DVD.	3.317
What if you were to take your face and put it on somebody else's face   and take their face and put it on yours.   What you would have is a face off.   This movie stars John Travolta and Nicolas Cage.   I am a big Nicolas Cage fan I think he's really cool   but Nicolas Cage is this really really bad bad guy.   He ends up killing John Travolta's son in the very beginning and John Travolta swears revenge.   He ends up getting really close in capturing him, in fact he captures him   but the problem is   before he captured him, he planted a bomb where no one else knows where it is so,   you gotta stop the bomb but here's the deal,   Nicolas Cage is knocked out cold    so what they do is they take John Travolta's face and they peel it off.   Then they take John Travolta's face and they peel it off   and they put it on John Travolta's face.   John Travolta then goes into a maximum security prison in order to get the information from Nicolas Cage's brother.  I know what you are thinking,   five out of five. I know the plot sounds wonderful.   You need to see it. This movie rocks.   But seriously, it's a B movie but it's still five out of five so it's going to be a little cheesy.	6.403
Okay I didn't think you could get much worse than Mortal Kombat when it comes to bad kung fu movies, but Romeo Must Die really wins the prize.  This is starring Jet Li and Aaliyah   (umm) about a   (uhh) a guy, Jet Li, who is trying to win the girl, Aaliyah. It's a pretty standard story and of course he has to deal with all these thugs along the way and it's just terrible. I mean the the (stutter) fighting is fun but the actual dialogue is awful. There's no plot, I mean I could have come up with something better than this.   And the cinematography just isn't all that great either and  the DVD itself right here isn't  too bad. I mean it's got a lot of special features for a DVD. It's got three music videos and a behind the scenes (umm) segment and all that. So that's definitely a plus.   But, other than that, I mean what good are special features when the movie itself is terrible?  So, for that I would give this movie a one out of five. It just really didn't do it. I left the theater  just completely disappointed. I don't know why I bought the DVD. I mean I guess it was it was (stutter) real cheap  at the Blockbuster so I just picked it up for laughs. But don't watch this unless you wanna watch a bad movie on purpose.  Romeo Must Die, with Jet Li and Aaliyah.   Bad news.   Good night.	6.055
I have a math problem for you now.   What is a really awesome Asian guy plus a really cocky   scrawny,   not so funny as he thinks he is black guy?  What happens when you add them together  and multiply it times two?  Well  for you mathematicians out there you'd guess it, it's Rush Hour Two with Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan.  I'll let you guess who the really cool Asian guy is.  (uhh) It's a really good movie as you can see Chris Tucker here is doing a little {mumble} you know (umm)  probably kind of insulting to the Asian people maybe who are really good at this stuff or  anybody who's good at this stuff.  The movie is decent. The movie is actually probably a one out of five.  I watched it when I was younger because I think in middle school,  there was like a really cool thing to go see Rush Hour because it was rated R.  (uhh) But we couldn't get in because we were eleven.  But some people snuck in and sat in the aisles.  I didn't think these movies are that great and in fact I don't even remember what Rush Hour was about.  (uhh) Much less Rush Hour Two.  That's why it's a one out of five, I have seen it.  (uhh) Basically Chris Tucker's a cop, he's a detective they get together and have some crazy antics.  You know, across the Middle East and America.  One out of five. You should probably see it if you have time.  Plus, they get to go to a (uhh) Asian Japanese, (stutter) what it, (uhh) Asian massage parlor.  That was really cool because you get to pick like five girls, so.  Rock on, one out of five.	6.055
I picked up Dark Blue on the recommendation of a friend.  (umm) and I must say that I was not impressed.  (umm) I was not really familiar with Kurt Russell outside of a few TV movies that I'd seen on TNT or TBS and I should have taken a clue from those movies because  (uhh) he just, as a lead actor he just does not carry this role. I cannot buy into him  (uhh) at all.  (stutter) His dialogue just comes across as cheesy. He can't deliver the one liners well.  (umm)  And all in all,   just, I just was not entertained by this movie at all. If you're looking for   (umm) a movie about corrupt cops and the battle from within, I would recommend Training Day or  (umm) I like Confidential  over Dark Blue  (uhh) any day of the week.  (umm) There are some memorable lines here, but again   the acting just really didn't deliver with the kind of conviction needed to make this movie believable.  It's not , it's not (stutter) a bad movie, it's just definitely not a great movie. If you've got nothing else to rent or to watch,  pick this one up. Otherwise, leave it alone.	6.055
I'm here to review this movie. This is called American Pie. And (uhh) this is the widescreen version. It's (uhh) unrated and (uhh) it runs for an hour and thirty-six minutes. (umm) The story on this is (uhh) okay. It's about, you know, (uhh) high school kids and (uhh) their obsession with sex. And, you know, we may have experienced that in our day, but this just brings it all out. And it's got some graphic scenes and (uhh) bad language.  So this is not recommended for (uhh) kids, you know, even, even (stutter) older kids. You know, use your own judgement on this. But (uhh) it's got some good acting in it. But, you know, it's, it's (stutter) (umm), it's kind of (uhh), you know, kind of bad for, you know, language and nudity and stuff like that. So (uhh) use your own judgement on this. And (uhh), you know, maybe you might enjoy this.  So I hope you try it. Prices will vary on (uhh) wherever you find it in your different local department stores, so (uhh) this is this is (stutter) American Pie. So thank you.	3.0
Hey. Today I'm going to be reviewing the two disc special edition of The Hulk  widescreen. This (uhh) is a pretty ridiculous movie. It covers the story of the Hulk, a man who is (uhh) a scientist exposed to gamma radiation and then ever since that exposure when he becomes angry he turns into the Hulk, a huge green (uhh) monster man with (uhh) unlimited power and invulnerability, and with the added feature that the angrier the Hulk gets the more powerful and more invulnerable he becomes.   So basically it's a,  it's a story, this is a story about a man who who (stutter)   suffers because he can't control his anger, but also uses this anger to lash out at society and his oppressors.   The movie kind of glosses over a lot of the (uhh) (stutter) a lot of the things that you could say with a story like that in favor of just pure action. The Hulk smashing tanks and smashing helicopters and jumping thousands of miles, and while that's entertaining it's I also don't think that's enough. I think you could have done a little bit more with this movie, with the subject matter. But portraying him as a tortured soul a little bit better, I don't know. But as it is, it's a,  it's a (stutter) fairly entertaining movie but very, very brainless. (uhh) The special effects are nice, but not enough to warrant  any kind of purchase or rental. I kind of wish I didn't have this. I give it a two. It's,   it's not as bad as, as (stutter) a one but like I said there's very, very little here to reclaim it and make it valuable. I give it a two.	3.786
Hey expotv. Here I have the movie Vin Diesel in The Pacifier. This movie is so funny.(umm)  It's awesome. It's the fullscreen version of course and (uhh) as you can see Vin Diesel, you know, tries to do all he can in raising the kids and  and it's just awesome. (umm) He comes in and he (uhh)  he just  he just (stutter)  it's an adventure. He has a babysitting job and it's so adventurous. It's by Walt Disney and it's hilarious. He tries to change diapers and   (umm)  spills juiceboxes all over and he just, it's just awesome. There's a lot of bonus features, it's great for the whole family. (umm) And it it's (stutter) Vin Diesel and he even has his shirt off in one of the scenes and that's  pretty hot, you know? (umm)   It's rated PG  and (uhh)  I was in (uhh) working at the hospital the other night and (uhh) some guy was watching it and he's just rolling, he loved it. And it's just a cool movie so I give it a five out of five star rating.	5.26
Hello, everybody. This is Helsing920 (stutter), and I've got a DVD review for everybody. And even though it is only, right now, at least, it is only, you know, July, I'm talking about holidays today, specifically, three of my all-time favorite holiday specials on one disc. I'm talking about Garfield Holiday Celebrations.   This one disc contains not only Garfield, not only Garfield's Halloween, Halloween (stutter) Adventure, a special I've I've (stutter) watched almost every year since I was about four, but it also has Garfield's (stutter) Thanksgiving, which is a pretty funny little short, funny little special, and A Garfield's Christmas, which is just absolutely awesome.  Honestly, if you are a fan of Garfield in any way, you're going to absolutely adore this thing. It's probably three of the best (stutter) holiday specials made in the last  (uhh) let's see. Let's see (stutter) now, the Halloween special, a little, I'm going to go about twenty-five years. And that's being really generous, because I know that the I know that the (stutter) Halloween Adventure was made after I was born, and I was born in eighty two. But still.  Regardless (umm) all three specials are just awesome. And this and this (stutter) disc, unfortunately, you really aren't going to find it in stores until around October, when everyone starts stocking up on Halloween DVDs. In fact, that's when I got this thing. Or I should say, that, that, that (stutter) is when my family picked up this thing.   And I sat down and I I (stutter) watched the whole thing at once.   And then, Thanksgiving, I watched it all again. And then Christmas, I watched it all again. I watched this thing three times in three months.   That's saying quite a bit, guys. So, yeah, Garfield's Halloween, or Holiday Celebrations. This thing, if you guys don't have it, you're going to need it for your holiday DVD list. I'm giving this beast a four out of, (stutter) I mean, (uhh) wait, four, no. Uh-uh. This sucker here gets full honors, guys. Five out of five. And if you can find it, pick it up.  Yeah.	6.055
Hey expotv. (umm) {clears throat} I'm going to be doing (umm) my review today on the movie Live Free or Die Hard (uhh) that's currently in theaters right now. It's also known as Die Hard Four. And (umm) it stars Bruce Willis who you may recognize from the other Die Hard movies. (umm) I wasn't necessarily a huge follower of the Die Hard series (uhh) beforehand, but,   you know, I heard about this movie, I heard some pretty good things about it and (umm) you know I decided to go check it and I'm really glad I did. It was a pretty action packed movie, and you know with a lot of movies today the the (stutter) digital use that they use a lot of, (umm) this movie pretty raw and real. Like a lot of the action scenes were done (umm), you know, with real sets and stuff like that. I'm not sure if they were but that's just kind of how it felt to me. And the story line was    was (stutter) pretty good. (umm) I guess it's it's (stutter),  you know, takes place on the fourth of July weekend and it kind of, the whole United States is getting shut down. (umm)  (umm)  But I don't want to give away too much of the story. (umm) Just know that it was it was (stutter) a little bit over two hours long and it didn't actually feel that long. (umm) It felt like it was a really good amount of time for a movie and (umm) definitely one worth seeing. So if you have a chance (uhh) go to the theaters, check out Die Hard Four, also known as Live Free or Die Hard. Five out of five stars, great movie.	5.416
Hi, (umm) today the product that I'm going to review is a DVD.  This is how, (stutter) called (umm), South Park Bigger, Longer, and Uncut.  (umm), I don't like this movie. I give it probably about a two,  (umm) because of some of the language it contains.  And, it's the story about four friends,   (umm), Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman, who sneak into  an, X-rated or R-Rated movie,  and it kind of warps their mind and then,  for some reason their parents start a war against Canada or something.  And it's about the four boys trying to save (umm),  some sort of Armageddon between us and Canada.  It's an animated film, probably about an hour and a half, maybe two hours long.   It's, (umm) as I said I don't like it, I'd give it about a two.  It's not appropriate for kids because there's a lot of cursing and things in it.  But, if you're interested in owning this,  you can find it on amazon dot com.  Also, DVD discounts for under twenty dollars.	4.082
(uhh) Now in theaters is a movie called Ratatouille  that's made by Disney Pixar studios.  It's a animated movie for kids,  but not always. I went to see it (umm) a couple days ago and I have to tell you  I loved the movie Ratatouille it's so funny, it's so crazy, (umm)  great imagination by the people that made it. I highly, highly recommend going to see Ratatouille especially if you love computer animated movies,  not just that. Also if you really really like (umm) Disney Pixar movies such as The Incredibles,  (umm) Toy Stories one and two,  (umm) Bug's Life and, well not Antz, (umm) Monsters Incorporated, Finding Nemo, if you like any of those movies,  definitely go see the movie Ratatouille out now in theaters.  Great, great movie about a rat that wants to become a chef.  (umm) Loses his family for a while but finds them later,  and that's not the entire story I'll let you, let you (stutter) see it for yourself. It's a great, great movie. I love the movie Ratatouille.   It's hilarious, it's funny,   it's just, it's just (stutter) a really fun movie to go see, you know instead of seeing the typical you know all of especially if you're a teenager you don't want to see movies like that definitely go see Ratatouille especially if you like computer animated movies,   or animated movies.  It's great, it's funny, I loved it,  highly recommend it, A plus plus plus plus, the movie Ratatouille. It's a great, great movie.	4.435
I recently viewed the movie Click  with Adam Sandler, and  I was very disappointed. I expected more, I'd seen the previews and I thought it looked like a pretty good story.  (umm) It's PG-thirteen,  but in this day and age, PG-thirteen it's harder to tell what,  what that really means, you know, well in this one there's lots of cussing,  (umm) there's some bedroom scenes, even though they don't show any skin you obviously know what they're doing.  (umm) There's  (uhh) a dog that keeps (uhh) humping the stuffed animal,  there's farting, I just I just (stutter) thought it was a rude movie. I loved the storyline.  You know, I love the fact of what the story about, in fact in even made me cry in the end. But  we could've done without all the other garbage that they added to this movie.  (umm)  I don't know why they do that to movies, and my husband was very leery of it too, because he said I've never seen an Adam Sandler movie that's actually been clean and (umm) and actually okay for children to watch.  So I'm gonna give this a two  just because  you know, it could (stutter) it had so  much potential,   and they just like,  trashed it up in my opinion.  So anyway, if you're going to watch this, I recommend not watching it with your children.	7.0
This is Dustin with a video review of the DVD called Legally Blonde.   Its starring Reese Witherspoon  and basically this movie is about this girl who   falls in love with this guy and basically thinks she need to go to law school to get him and of course,   she goes to Harvard   and (umm)   as you can see, she doesn't really fit in by the cover. I mean she wears pink and dresses in stiletto shoes and everything and   you know and that's not really the whole college scenes anyways.  But basically it's about like you know, girl power and this stuff and like how blondes rule and all this   and how everything goes her way because she's pretty.   (uhh) This movie is,   I would give it a one out of five, it is garbage. (umm)   They say two thumbs up (umm) they're lying. On the back they say a feel good girl power comedy. (uhh)   It's definitely girl power, (uhh) I would not consider this movie very funny (uhh) but maybe if you're a girl, you would enjoy it   but as far as me personally, I give this one out of five and am throwing it away after this.	4.69
This is Dustin with the DVD review of Malibu's Most Wanted. It's starring Jamie Kennedy so you know this movie is gonna be hilarious. (umm)  This is actually one of my favorite comedy movies out there to this day.  (uhh) Basically it's about  Jamie Kennedy plays this character named Brad, or as he likes to be called B-Rad, and his dad is running for mayor  but basically Jamie Kennedy is an embarrassment to his dad, and basically ruins their name and everything and (uhh)  his dad tries to scare him straight so he doesn't try to become a rapper or act,   like, ghetto like he does or whatever. And (uhh) he has these two men in the, on the (stutter) front here kidnap him and try to scare him into being  more of a preppy  person that his dad wants him to be.   (umm)  Overall this movie is hilarious. I would definitely see this movie, I give it a five out of five, and if you don't like it you're insane.	5.745
This is the movie Ninja Scroll.   It's on DVD.   (uhh) This is a really great movie if you like animation type movies and   kind of a samurai ninja fighting styles.   (uhh) This   according to Access Magazine it has excellent top of the line animation, so if that's what you're into   you'll definitely like this game.   (uhh) Wired Magazine calls it a relentless Japanese anime feast   which I guess   tells you right there if you like anime,   then you should   definitely try this one out.   (uhh) The story is set in feudal Japan,   which they describe as a time of danger, intrigue, and deception.   It starts out with a young ninja named Jubai   who has no master and travels the land alone.   (uhh) He hires his services out to people who are wealthy and can pay him for them.   And it kind of follows his story   when he finds a village that's   succumbed to this terrible plague.   I won't give away the ending, but   if you like anime you should   check out this movie   because it's a really great anime.	2.944
Hello, I'm here to review Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford.  Special Edition.  (uhh), this is a great film, if you haven't seen it I really recommend it,  as I do with most films that I review because I only do DVD's that I like.  (umm), it's the story of two outlaws,  (umm) Butch Cassidy, played by Paul Newman, and the Sundance Kid, played by Robert Redford, who are much more handsome than they were in real life.  The real outlaws were, pretty ugly fellows.  (umm) And basically their adventures trying to keep one step ahead of the law and (uhh),  they end up in a foreign country for a while. (uhh) Then get involved in crimes there.  So its (uhh), a far reaching adventure old west style.  But (uhh) what makes it different than most westerns is the comedy and the chemistry between these two is really, really good. And they're very memorable characters.  They're not your kind of normal stoic western types, they're (uhh) it it's (stutter) more like a, kind of like a buddy comedy.  It also happens to be a western adventure.    (umm), As far as the DVD goes.  Single disc.  (umm), Fair amount of special features though.  You get a good commentary track from, I believe the director, nope, yes, the director.  And also some interviews and a really long documentary about the making of the film.  I think it's forty-five minutes long.  Really good if you have, you know, a strong interest in the movie it's worth checking out.  And (uhh), just for the performances alone this one's worth it.  But the story is also good and (uhh) very funny.  And the the (stutter) weirdest (uhh) music montage ever put on film. So check it out.	6.055
Corbitt here reviewing Hostel: Part two.  Hostel: Part two is currently in theaters and it is directed by Eli Roth who also directed Hostel one and Cabin Fever.   Hostel: Part two is a very gruesome movie.  (umm) that is basically about   a  online type site where people pay to go to these foreign countries and basically kill tourists for money.  (umm) Basically it's very gruesome. I wouldn't say it's the best movie. If you're a fan of the original Hostel, you might wanna check it out. But   (uhh) I'd actually think that it's worse than the first one. Like I said, it's very gruesome and really that's the only thing the director tried to do is basically   (uhh) make people squirm in their seats because of how gruesome it is and if you're looking for that kind of movie you might enjoy it. But (uhh) overall I'm not really happy with it.   (uhh) I definitely don't think it's worth   a movie  (uhh) ticket. Spending all that money to go to the movies especially if you're going with someone else. But   (umm) if you have a chance to see it, check it out. But   (uhh) overall I wouldn't really recommend it. So  (uhh) that's it, Hostel: Part two.	4.435
Hello. I want to talk to you about Live Free or Die Hard. Of course this is with Bruce Willis yet again, another Die Hard movie, and if you love the first three you're probably going to like this one because it really does carry on in the same vein. You get to see all the character traits (uhh) that we saw in the first three movies and overall I think they were very true to the character.  This movie is a little bit different because, you know, in the first Die Hard movie (uhh) Bruce Willis was confined to one building, and the second movie he was confined to one airport, and the third movie he was confined to one city, and this one I think he's kind of confined to one (uhh)  coastal region cause he goes everywhere. He's in Boston, and Virginia, and (stutter) the capital, and all over the place. He starts out in New York so he kind of gets to travel around a lot more in this movie which is interesting that is an element we haven't really seen in the previous movies. Another thing that's a little bit different in this movie is that it is PG-thirteen where I believe the other three were rated R. I don't think this movie suffers from that in any way, there's still lots of (stutter) action and this is not a movie you want to take small children to but it is one you can feel comfortable maybe taking your teenagers to. I think this is a great movie. If you loved the first ones, if you like the (stutter)   John McClane, you should definitely check out this movie.	5.0
Hey   (umm) I would like to talk about   (uhh) Ratatouille.  (umm) This is  (uhh) Pixar's new  (umm) animated feature.  (umm) It is about a rat named Remy who lives in Paris and  (umm) he has a fascination with cooking and  (uhh) eventually   helps, helps (stutter) the main human character Linguini kinda become this great chef at this restaurant in Paris.  (umm) Pixar's done other films   (uhh) such as Toy Story, Toy Story two,  (uhh) Finding Nemo, Monsters Incorporated, Cars,  (umm) and Pixar   (uhh) has never really disappointed people very much.   (umm) They're kind of the leader in the   (uhh) the animated film   (umm) sorta section of movies and  (uhh) Ratatouille was great. It was what I was expecting and it it (stutter) delivered.  (umm) It was funny, it was entertaining, it was good. Patton Oswalt did great voice acting for (uhh) Remy the rat.   (uhh) It was just a really good movie and I recommend it to people of all ages. Ratatouille, it's very good.	3.697
Attention ladies, attention   action flick fans. I have got a triple feature for you that's gonna knock your socks off. That's right, the triple feature is a Vin Diesel triple feature. Who can't love Vin Diesel? He's great at action, looks great in a shirt, looks great in no shirt. Great movie.  The triple feature includes Knockaround Guys, A Man Apart and Boiler Room. Three of Vin Diesel's most fantastic movies if I can say so myself.  Now this DVD, well it only costs me a little under ten dollars. That's about three dollars per movie. Count em, three three three ten dollars for three Vin Diesel movies. Who can't love that?  The movie, all of them, they're rated R. There's a lot of violence, a lot of shoot em up, a lot of things that kids can't watch. But for us adults, who love all that action, this triple feature is a value. Each of the movies is easy to watch. Each of the movies has a storyline that you don't really have to think too much about, it's just fun to sit, eat some popcorn and watch the movie and watch things get blown up, if you know what I mean.  So guess what, this is a five star for me. This triple feature is a great value, three three three, you heard it, less than ten dollars for three Vin Diesel movies. Add this one to your collection.	6.683
Hey ExpoTv.   One of the famous rock concerts of all time   was in nineteen seventy-one.  in Madison Square Garden,   The Concert for Bangladesh   with (uhh) George Harrison and friends.  This is the DVD version,   (uhh) this is probably one of my favorite concerts ever.  It's (uhh) it's got everyone, its got George Harrison, the former Beatle,   this is one year after they broke up.   (uhh) It has Eric Clapton, it's has Bob Dylan.  It's just got got (stutter) Billy Preston,   it's got all these great people.   (uhh) It's got lots of songs, eighteen songs on this.  (umm) You know, everyone just does a couple songs here and there, there in a mix in a lot of them but, it's  it's great (umm)  The song quality isn't the (uhh) best cause it's nineteen seventy-one but it (uhh) it's cool to watch to see how they did all this stuff, you can see (uhh)  some of the old school recording techniques and  but basically you just get to see real musicians playing real music  and it's good, it's a great concert,   (uhh) five out of five stars, for this thumbs way up.	4.83
Hi. I'm (uhh) reviewing the movie Wild Hogs, which is currently in theaters and (umm)   pretty upset that I had to sit through this movie. (uhh)   I I (stutter) didn't even want to go to this movie, I was dragged to this movie,   (uhh)   girlfriend and other people had to see it so   guess I went along. (uhh)   The trailer looks stupid, the (stutter) you know, it it's (stutter) basically mainstream comedy (uhh)   not very funny, I really didn't, didn't (stutter) like much of it (uhh). Basically kind of old, generic jokes that we've all heard before (uhh), nothing,  nothing (stutter) not a lot of new material that I haven't heard before. I watch a lot of comedy specials. If you're a (uhh) a fan of comedy at all (uhh)   I wouldn't waste my time watching this (uhh)   it really wasn't exciting. I think I laughed, maybe,   maybe I chuckled once, that would be a good word. Maybe a smirk or two. But besides that (umm)  I can't really can't give this a stamp of approval (uhh)   just, it was just a childish plot, you know.   Bunch of suburban bikers didn't really interest me, so   if you're not interested in that I don't, I wouldn't, I can't recommend this movie.   Not good, not good at all.	4.082
Hi, this is Nicky.   This is my review on the movie Live Free Or Die Hard.   This was a really great movie.   Once again John McClane can't die.  (uhh) That man goes through  any and everything,  and manages to walk away.  (uhh)  Your typical Die Hard movie,  but I have to say out of the four this is the best one.  I would give this one two thumbs up, it had a decent storyline,  there were a few  obviously unbelievable parts but it sure is  fun to watch  the possibilities of making it through  the things that John McClane goes through.  Anyway I would definitely  recommend this movie  (uhh)  boy I don't know what they're gonna do to top this one.  (uhh) Bruce Willis getting a little bit on the old side but  you never know.  So he does still have his daughter.  So I would definitely check this one out.	5.0
This is a review of the movie Ratatouille.  (uhh) It's a movie about a rat who lives in the French countryside but (umm) he dreams of becoming a famous chef.   (uhh) So he ends up making his way to Paris and once he's there he meets a human boy   (uhh) who gets a job at a French restaurant.  (umm) The rat is able to control the boy so that (umm) the boy's making the dishes that the rat wants him to make. As a result, the boy becomes famous for making such delicious food when really the rat is the one who is responsible for (uhh) making the dishes.  (umm) This movie was excellent.  (uhh) I would recommend it to anyone. I think that  (uhh) it would appeal to all age groups.  (umm) In fact I think that the movie was perhaps geared toward a more mature audience.  (umm) A lot of the humor felt more mature than than (stutter) in previous Pixar movies.  (umm) But I still think that kids would enjoy it equally as well.  (umm) Overall I would give this movie an A plus and as I said I would recommend it to anyone.	5.745
Hi I'm Caroline, today I'd like to review The   League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.   (uhh) I did not like this movie at all, I would not recommend it. I only watched half of it because I didn't like the rest of the movie.   It is rated PG-thirteen.   (uhh) It is a mind-blowing adventure.   It has Sean Connery in it, {laugh} which is probably the biggest name in here.   And little do you know that (uhh) the league extraordinary gentlemen has a woman in it and each of these (uhh) five people   have different powers,   and (uhh) they're all a little bit special at what they do, and (uhh)  you've got a vampire in there, you've got an invisible man.   And they just go out and try to save   save (stutter) {sigh} I guess these European countries and save the world from going into another world war. So (umm)  (uhh) it's a little interesting, it says it has eye popping effects and amazing action and it is definitely an action,   probably for the guys out there, but really strange. Almost like a  (umm) I don't know, really weird comic strip that you're gonna get. Comic, you know one of those   weird ones that they put out.   So (uhh) Sean Connery, the (stutter) League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. I would not recommend this movie.	5.745
Hello I'm Matthew and I'm here to tell you about this DVD movie,  this is Back to School and it stars Rodney Dangerfield.  (umm) He was a comedian actor back (umm)  in the eighties and nineties and he recently just passed away a few years ago.  (umm) The run time on this DVD is an hour and thirty-six minutes  and (umm) it was made in nineteen  (umm) eighty-six, so it's more than twenty years old  and (umm) if you like Rodney Dangerfield  you'll probably like this DVD (umm)  {sniff} I personally don't like him as an actor (umm), most people say he's a comic genius,  and  this is strictly just my personal opinion  (umm)  I think he's (umm) annoying and not funny  (umm) I just never really liked him as an actor at all, (umm) but that's just my personal opinion (umm) if you find  (umm) him funny (umm) this is great, because it's on DVD (umm) the clarity (umm) is really really good on it  and (umm)  if you're into him, you can buy this DVD (umm) I bought it at Best Buy which is a DVD retailer (umm) for about nine dollars and if you (umm) want  (umm)  to go pick this up I got it for a gift for someone and (umm) if you want to pick it up you can order it on amazon dot com	3.109
I'm holding Cheaper by the Dozen DVD set starring Steve Martin, Bonnie Hunt, Tom Welling, and Hillary Duff. (umm) This movie was put out in two-thousand-three and it was given to (umm) to me as a gift but but (stutter) you can purchase it at Walmart for fifteen dollars. (umm) This movie's okay, it's not my favorite. (umm) Steve Martin (uhh) and Bonny Hunt do a great a job acting, Steve Martin is hilarious as ever (umm)  but it wasn't  the best family movie in the world. There were some things in there that just didn't really stick with me, I I (stutter) kind of thought they should have left it out for a family movie. (umm)   But (stutter) all the kids in the movie are great actors and great actresses, they really have a good cast, just think the writing could have been a little different. So if you're looking for, you know, a clean family film this isn't really it. (umm) It's rated PG. (umm) Again you can buy it at Walmart for fifteen dollars. (umm) I've also seen it at Target so you can buy it there for about the same price. So (umm) anyways, this is Cheaper by the Dozen. I give it a two.	4.83
Hi this is Kai xxx and today I'm reviewing Total Recall special edition in the limited Mars tin case.  (uhh)   This is really cool, you've got your tin case here.  (uhh) Opens up,  show the DVD it's got a nice little foam insert in there.  (uhh) And overall Total Recall  an absolute blast. If you haven't seen it (uhh)  Arnold Schwarzenegger  (uhh) plays sort of a mild-mannered who ends up getting tangled up in this  (uhh) sort of pseudo-mafia kind of organized crime. (uhh)  Territory war over Mars. (uhh) There's a corrupt government on Mars who's charging people for air.  (uhh) There are people who are being mutated  (uhh) and developing psychic powers it's, it's (stutter) just an absolute great action sci-fi movie.  Lots of twists and turns,  (uhh) little deeper than your average Arnie movie which still isn't saying too much. But  (uhh) really quotable, lot of great lines. If you're gonna get a DVD I recommend the special edition. (uhh) The Mars case  takes a little getting used to (uhh) when you try to fit it in with the rest of your DVDs.  But overall comes with some (uhh)  cool making of features  and really this is just a really innovative case, it's a really cool way to do a DVD promo.  (uhh) I'm glad they did it and it's definitely worth checking out.  I would give the Total Recall special edition in the limited Mars tin case  a four out of five. A great movie.  A cool marketing (uhh) product.  And overall something you should be happy to add to your collection.  Check it out.	5.745
Hi I'm here to review (uhh)  Drumline  DVD starring Nick Cannon.  (umm)  You may know him from (uhh) from All That when he was (uhh)  when he was younger,  and (uhh) now more recently he's been (uhh)  starring in  his own show on MTV called (uhh) Wild and Out.  (umm) Nick Cannon is pretty funny guy  but (um)  you know when it comes to  playing a serious role  as this,  (uhh) he's,  he doesn't (uhh)  doesn't really cut it very well.  (umm) He's not a very good movie.  (uhh) I mean it is good if you like watching the (um)   the whole band and everything.  (umm) Like whole  black college  (uhh) band   battles.   (uhh)   But I mean,   really the movie's only good for those scenes where they're actually doing their (uhh)   their battling.  The (uhh)  the dialog isn't that great,  the (uhh)  storyline is is (stutter) pretty predictable, pretty cheesy  you know.  (uhh) So I mean I wouldn't suggest this unless you were just watching it just to watch the (uhh)  the bands, but I mean you can do that any you know college football game.  So all in all,  don't get this (uhh)  Drumline DVD.  It's not worth it.	4.082
Hi, it's just me Jill and I am going to review  Star Wars the Empire Strikes Back Episode Five.  This movie came out in nineteen-eighty (umm)  and this particular version is a wide screen limited edition that I got from Walmart for about twenty bucks.  It came out with this great comic book to go with it (umm).  This movie is awesome.  (uhh) The visual (umm) effects in this movie are are (stutter) really great. I mean  you can't go wrong with any Star Wars movie although I do like episodes (umm)  these newer, these episodes the older episodes, episodes four, five and six a little bit better than the newer ones, the one, two and three  (umm) I still think  this is a great movie I mean  Darth Vader as an evil character, (umm) Chewbacca,  Han Solo all the great (umm) fighting scenes in it  you know you you (stutter) just love this movie.  Star Wars.	5.066
This is Wild Wild West and it stars Will Smith, Kevin Kline and Selma Hayek.  And while I'm actually usually a pretty big fan of (umm) Will Smith movies because I think he's, you know, he's a good actor. But (uhh) you know even he couldn't save this movie. (umm) This was (uhh)  basically just not a good movie. I mean the plot was terrible.  (uhh) A lot of the like you know a lot of the little gadgets that they through into the movie and you know were just bad ideas. (umm)  I mean I guess it's entertaining to watch once or once you know like ever and (stutter) just to see how bad it was. But (umm) I mean (stutter) you think with actually a you know a somewhat decent cast that they pull off a you know, better movie but they don't. (umm)  (uhh) Yeah (uhh) There's a whole bunch of special features. There's a you know behind the scenes documentaries, Will Smith and Enrique Eglasias (uhh) music videos, director commentary and you know they threw in a whole bunch of stuff but you know it doesn't really make the movie you know it doesn't make the movie any better. So  I give this movie a two out of five. (umm)  Like I said I'm a huge fan of Will Smith and (uhh) (stutter) basically everything he's been in, but (uhh)  this is just (uhh) this wasn't a good movie.  So you know if you get a chance to see this (uhh) you know for free or something  then I'd say yeah give it a shot but (uhh)  you probably won't enjoy it very much.	4.509
Alright (uhh) this is going to be a review of a foreign film Old Boy.  This film comes (uhh) from Korea and it is highly regarded as (uhh) just a great film overall.  (uhh) I'm not, I can't go into the plot or the storyline without giving anything away, without giving (stutter) any spoilers away,  but I can set up the story. (uhh) Dae-Su is a Korean man who one day gets locked up in this hotel room. He is basically jailed for fifteen years  and he doesn't know why. And the rest of the film involves him trying to find out why he got locked up, who did this to him, and he tries to see if he can exact revenge on the person who (uhh) who jailed him for fifteen years. (uhh) this a wonderful (uhh) masterpiece.  If you're not into foreign films, you probably will be after watching this. (uhh) I recommend watching it in the dubbed, (uhh) not the dubbed but the subtitled version (uhh) just to get the the (stutter) entire effect, the entire feel of it. It is done great. (uhh) the actors are great, storyline is great. There's some twists, there's some turns, and (umm) you know this is  just some, this is a movie that you have to have in your collection (uhh) if you are a movie goer.	5.0
Hi, today I'd like to review Shark Tale on DVD,  and this was another of the many animated movies.  (umm) This one features voice actors such as Will Smith, Robert De Niro, Renee Zellweger, Angelina Jolie, Jack Black and even director Martin Scorsese.  (umm) This was an entertaining enough movie. It  it's got a pretty generic story about some fish and  it (umm) features a real musical sequences to popular seventies songs. But overall I found it to be just kind if  generic and it was just made to capitalize on the popularity of movies like Shrek or Toy Story.  Plus it just used the voice acting cast to gain popularity even though it's kind of distracting in that you just kind of  hear the celebrities but not the characters.  (umm) DVD does have a good bit of special features (umm) that kids will enjoy like  bloopers and interactive things about the music and the special effects and interviews with the cast. So  (umm) overall I think I'd recommend this for kids cause I think they'd probably enjoy it, but otherwise  (umm) I wouldn't recommend it because it's just pretty generic and lazy and  not that interesting. So that's my review of Shark Tale on DVD.	2.944
Hi. Today I'd like review Die Another Day, the  James Bond movie starring Pierce Brosnan and Halle Berry. And  this is one of the more recent James Bond movies but I found that it's just  really silly overall. (umm) I mean it has some entertaining action sequences, some cool gadgets and cars and stuff, but  overall it just feels  tired and old and not that engaging. (umm)  The DVD however is quite good. It's, this is the two disc ultimate edition DVD, part of the  James Bond ultimate edition set, and (umm)  has several features on  the two discs it comes in. (umm) Like audio commentary,  (umm) lots of featurettes and documentaries, interactive  things you can do. (uhh) Trailers, DVD-rom features, (umm)  great audio and video quality so  it's got a lot of features and it's generally a great DVD set but the movie's not really that good so I (stutter) don't think I'll recommend it. That's my review of Die Another Day on DVD.	3.559
Hi, I'm Peter  and I'm reviewing this movie,  Dazed and Confused,  and it's  set in the seventies.  It's the slogan is,  it was the last day of school in nineteen sevety six, a time they'd never forget if only they could remember.  And it's a kind of classic  stoner flick comedy.  And it's (umm)  about  a group of high school  students arranging from freshman all the way up to  (stutter) they're graduating and those that have  grip, been graduated and still hang around with all the younger kids, and  it takes a really funny view on all their lives  and (umm)  it's. In the back here it says it was all, bong bongs (stutter) and bell-bottoms, polyester, pupa shells, and mood rings. We rocked and rolled, we were jaded and innocent but most of all we were dazed and confused.  And it was  really funny and  I would definitely recommend it.  It's got a bunch of  actors that I don't really know but I recognize.  And (umm)  a lot of them are only famous from this {laugh}  besides Matthew McCounaghey's gone on to do bigger things, but  still they do a good job.  It's a really funny movie and if you like a  seventies setting,  and a stoner flick comedy, then this is for you, Dazed and Confused.	3.0
Hi, this is my review of Jurassic Park Three.  (uhh) This is the third Jurassic Park, obviously, in the series and unlike the previous two it is not directed by Steven Spielberg. He does executive produce, but it is (uhh) directed by Joe Johnston.  (umm)  What I found most exciting about this movie when I first heard about that they were making a third is that it once again stars Sam Neill who was absent in the second movie.  (umm) Unfortunately (uhh) when I ended up seeing it I was pretty disappointed all around.  (uhh) The second movie I didn't think was nearly as good as the first, which is one of my all-time favorite movies, but (uhh) the second still had some good aspects to it and it was overall a pretty enjoyable movie. (uhh) The third one just feels completely (uhh) unneeded.  It seems like we've seen all this before, (uhh) and seen it better. There's really not a whole lot original original (stutter) concept left in it. (uhh) the story's just kind of a rehash of the previous movie and it overall just feels very forced. I don't think it was needed at all and I didn't really enjoy it. I actually found it pretty hard to sit through.   So (uhh) I definitely will not recommend this movie. I would say you could skip it entirely even if you were a fan of the previous movies.  (uhh) So  unfortunately (uhh) a great series that really just lived on longer than I think it needed to. (uhh) This has been my review of Jurassic Park Three.	4.359
Hi, Hi everybody this is (uhh) my review for (uhh) Napoleon Dynamite which is a comedy that was released in two thousand three, or two thousand four excuse me. (umm) It was (uhh)  promoted by (uhh) MTV Films.  (umm) This movie was (uhh) written and directed by Jarred Hest and (uhh) there's actually a pretty unique (uhh) story behind this. Jarred Hest is (uhh) Mormon and he wanted to create a comedy that could be funny without being (umm) too adult or inappropriate using foul language or things like that. So he (uhh) set out to create this movie with a really low budget and it's kind of reflected it's it's (stutter) (uhh) little bit of an independent film. (umm) It stars John Heder who plays a (uhh) a teenager in high school,  and he does a great job acting in this and it's really funny. The guy just has all these quirks and (umm) all these little things and (umm) he's kind of a dork and it's (uhh) just a really funny portrayal of a person. And basically (uhh) this guy that Jon Heder plays, (uhh) he decides to run for class presidency, class president (stutter) and (umm) so you see him meet (umm) new people and he interacts with a girl and then there's a new friend played by (umm)  (uhh)  (uhh) Ramirez and (uhh) that's Pedro. (uhh) So (uhh) this movie, it's a great teen movie. It's really funny and it's very unique film. (umm) Not many other comedies are like this. So I recommend everybody checks this out. It's really a great movie and you should see it at least once.  And also as a side note, it's a great movie to watch with (umm) groups of people. (umm) It's more funny if (uhh) there's more people laughing. And (uhh) so I really recommend you watch this with a bunch of your friends. I hope you enjoy.	3.0
HI, today I'm going to review the movie Once, currently in theaters.  (umm) Once is about a  guy who's a guitar. It's an Irish movie. It's a foreign film.  It's Irish okay and it's it's (stutter)  very indie. So it's   (umm) pretty low budget. So learn to deal with that cause it's an amazing movie.  Anyway  it's about a guy. He plays guitar, he loves playing guitar. But he just can't make a break into the music industry and  (uhh) he finds this girl. Well this girl comes and listens to him play and  they talk and he's a vacuum cleaner he's a vacuum cleaner (stutter) fixer upper.  (uhh) And so she needs her vacuum fixed up and they meet and they become friends and he falls in love with her, you know.  It's this classic story but the best part about it is the music, the music, the music. They're both musicians and they just make some fantastic music. The soundtrack is so good.  It's all about their music that they make and  (uhh) I would really recommend it. It's a very good love story, it's got fantastic music and it's only like an hour and a half.  Excellent movie, go see Once and then get the soundtrack.	4.69
I'm here to review this movie called Millennium.  And it stars Kris Kristofferson. And it's an older movie. It's been out for quite a while, but it's on (uhh) DVD now. And (uhh) it's rated PG-thirteen. And this is (uhh) about time travel. And about (uhh) people way in the future that (uhh) come back to our time and different times and (uhh) the the (stutter) things that they do. I don't want to mess up the story for you, but (uhh) it's interesting because, you know, it's about futuristic things and time travel, but (uhh) the story's kind of, kind of (stutter) nothing. You know? It's kind of boring and it's so far out there and (uhh) it's just kind, it's just really unbelievable. But if you like the idea of time travel and that kind of thing, you might enjoy this, because it gives you a little different idea about, you know, how things might be.  So (uhh) it's been, it's an older movie, like I said. It's been out for a long time, but you can find it on DVD now, and (uhh) your prices will vary. So (uhh) try it and (uhh) you may enjoy it, you know, more than I did. So (uhh) I hope you can find it.	4.435
Hey guys, what's up? Right now I'm going to review the movie Live Free or Die Hard featuring Bruce Willis.  By far Live Free or Die Hard, or known as Die Hard Four, is probably my favorite as best movie in the Die Hard series. Bruce Willis is your old, your (umm) your (stutter) old typical cop but basically this time he's fighting internet (umm) terrorists. Basically the terrorists have hacked into the FBI's like security measures and they're like taking over the world, or the United States at least. And  you know saving as always the cop goes in, save the days. But basically this movie it was more xxx than your average action movie.  The effects, like the shootout scenes, were amazing. They were done amazingly. When you're in the theater and you're watching them shootout each other you actually feel like you're there. The story it was actually done really well. It wasn't just your typical like you know terrorist then you know cop comes in and saves the day. There was like more plot to it than that. The action scenes were my favorite parts though.  It's one of the best action blockbuster I've seen this whole summer and I highly recommend you guys seeing it.  Bruce Willis does his role perfectly, everything is done perfect. The casting was really good, the effects were awesome. I definitely recommend you guys watching that movie. You (uhh) you won't be disappointed. It was one of my favorite movies this summer.	6.403
All right, Hi ExpoTV, my name is Landon and I'm going to talk to you about the (uhh) Baker Three skateboarding video.  And (uhh) it has a parental advisory on it for the explicit lyrics because it's a pretty (uhh) raw skateboarding movie.  It's (uhh)  like on the back it says (uhh)  not your parent's skate video, because  it's definitely a teenage movie, like in  (uhh) but it's also really good, it's one of the most like,  best skate videos to ever be produced. It's got Jeff Lanost, Terry Kennedy, Justin Dolland, Eric Ellington, Jim Grecco, Brian Herman,  (uhh) Kevin Long, Andrew Reynolds, Braden  and Antoine Dixon which is the new guy on the team who came through with a really good part.  And it's all of these people with (uhh) full footage parts with (uhh) good songs to them and (uhh)  it's just a really good skateboarding video that gets you really psyched to go skate. So if you're ever just sitting around and like  before you go out skateboarding or something, throw this in and maybe like, learn a couple new things or  even get yourself like psyched to go skate, so. You should definitely check this one out, I think.	3.416
Alright hi Expo TV. My name is Landon and (uhh) I was gonna talk to you about the Thrasher Skater of the Year video.  This is a video put together by Thrasher magazine, which is one of the most popular skateboarding magazines out there   and (uhh) it's every year they pick (stutter) a skater of the year, which is the person that they thought put in the most work and produced prolly like the best skateboarding part usually  of (uhh) the whole year and it's like a really big award to win and  (uhh) they've been doing it for awhile now and  (uhh) this is a video of like all the parts from every person who's won skater of the year since like the first year they started doing it. So   and like it shows their part, which is like they won the video so, or the skater of the year award. So  it's really fun to watch and it's also just like shows you progression of skateboarding every year you can tell why each person won that year because  I mean they really stepped it up. So  it's a really good video and (uhh) psychs you up to skate. So I hope you like it, cause I did. Alright thank you.	4.435
Hi. This is Mama three for ExpoTV.   Today I would like to review the Disney DVD, The Fox and the Hound.  This film was originally released in nineteen eighty-one,  it is rated G and it's eighty-three minutes long.  It follows the story of a hound dog named Copper   and a   fox cub named Todd  and when they're young,  they are friends but one winter, Copper goes away  with his (umm)  owner and  he's taught to be an hound dog that hunts  and when he comes back,  he's suppose to be hunting Todd and that causes conflict  in their relationship.  This is not one of my favorite  movies, it doesn't seem to hold my kids attention either  so no matter what the price of it is,   it's not one, that I would recommend buying.  It does have some special features on here, there is the trailer, there a (stutter)  trivia game, there's a read along,  which actually my kids actually enjoy better than the movie.  This is not a movie that I recommend that you have to buy, maybe it's one to rent instead.	4.123
Corbit here reviewing the movie Simply Irresistible starring Sarah Michelle Gellar and this movie is about a cook who's restaurant is closing and she wishes that (umm) everything went okay in her life and what ends up happening is (umm)  Her restaurant goes well and she falls in love with this guy. And this is a kind of a bargain movie basement movie. (umm)  You can pick it up in like the the (stutter) five dollar bin at Walmart or something but (umm)  It's an okay love story. I really think it's pretty average to your typical love story movie. And (umm) I guess it does an okay job at that. But (umm) this  (umm) movie doesn't really have any bonus features. It has both widescreen and full screen editions of the movie which is a really nice touch for people who don't have an HD TV. But really other than that it only has (uhh) the original trailer, which is a pretty much a disappointment even though this is a cheap DVD. (umm) I'm sure even fans of Simply Irresistible even want to see behind the scenes, or maybe some commentary. But (umm) overall I'd probably only give this two out of five stars. So (umm) if you're a fan of the love, comedy movies and you like Sarah Michelle Gellar, check out Simply Irresistible.	4.435
Hi, my name is Leslie and today I would like to review for you  a classic and one of the favorites in our household,  It's the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown.  (umm) This is a Peanuts classic and it is available in DVD wherever DVDs are sold.  (umm) With the upcoming Halloween season I'm excited about having this in our dvd library.  I grew up loving this movie.  (umm) And it would always air on our local cable tv channel and  around Halloween time and we would always dvr at or, set our vcrs to tape it because we wanted to watch it over and over and over again.  And now (umm) that it's available on dvd I rushed out and got it because I just love having this in our house,  not only for Halloween time but year round.  (umm) It's so, the wonderful classic where (umm) poor Linus tries to convince everybody that (umm) the great pumpkin exists,  he even writes a letter to the great pumpkin just like Santa, and he convinces Lucy to stay out in the pumpkin patch all night and skip trick or treating   (umm) in hopes of, of (stutter) seeing the great pumpkin and he (umm) thinks he'll bring him lots of presents.  (umm) You'll have to watch it to see if the great pumpkin does show up,  but this is just a great movie, of course Charlie Brown's getting rejected as usual, as everyone's getting trick or treat candies in their bags, Charlie Brown keeps getting rocks,  and that just makes me and my kids laugh every time.  (umm) There are great bonus features in this including a bonus movie, you get (umm)  You're Not Elected, Charlie Brown, which is another thirty minute feature on this DVD as well as Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown. So  if you do not have this in your DVD collection I recommend you running out and getting it.	7.0
Hi, I'm reviewing the movie  Three-Hundred, starring Gerald Gerald (stutter) Butler as King Leonidas, the king of the Spartans. (umm)  It is  a movie based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller who also brought you Sin City.  It's graphically beautiful. I believe this movie is graphic eye candy, although it is very bloody. It's maybe not suitable for those who may have a weak stomach, which you'd have to have a pretty weak stomach. (umm)  Also for children, I don't, I wouldn't recommend it for children. {noise} There's a lot of fighting, lots of action. There's a little bit of romance. There's some history, it's based on the battle of Thermopylae. (umm)  I really like this movie, I have it in my DVD collection, I'd recommend it to anyone for their DVD collection. If you're into  very well done scenes, good makeup, good acting, this is a good movie to have. If you haven't seen it I would definitely recommend you run at it and rent it or purchase it {noise} but Three-Hundred. Thanks.	4.082
Hi, this is Momofthree for Expo TV.  Today I'd like to review the Disney movie, it's out in theaters.  (umm) It's a rerelease of The Nightmare Before Christmas  only this time it's in three D.  Here's my movie ticket from it.  (umm) It just came back out again a couple weeks ago  and when you go, you do get these  cool 3D glasses.  We used some Super Saver passes on it and they made us pay an extra dollar fifty. I'm not sure if that is for  if you were just going into see it  paying the regular admission if you have to pay extra or not. But you're prolly paying the dollar fifty to get these three D glasses that comes with the movie.  The 3D part, I was a little worried about my kids being scared about things popping out at them. But it seems to be more  it was   put the three D in   depth wise and not like  some of the movies that are at the Disney theme parks, where you feel like things are getting right in your face.  There was a little bit of that but not too much at all.  It is the story of Jack Skellington who is the king of Halloween town and he gets bored with the same old scaring and everything that happens at Halloween and he discovers Christmas and he'd like the  members of Halloween town to help him try to take over Christmas time.  It's a fun story. Some kids might be scared by some of the elements of it. It is rated PG.  (umm) The runtime on it is seventy-six minutes, which is just great time limit for a kids movie. You're in and out of there. This is one that I would recommend for the family to go see.	5.972
Hi, I'm here to review the movie The Good The Bad and The Ugly starring Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach.  They are three  desperadoes in search of a fortune.  (umm) This movie  (uhh) the Good the Bad and the Ugly (uhh) was the first of the so-called spaghetti westerns where Sergio Leone, the director, (uhh) brought American actors  (uhh) to Italy to film American Westerns. The American Western at this time had pretty much lost favor with American directors.  And  there weren't that many (uhh) Westerns being made anymore.  (umm) this movie   (umm) kind of brought a renewed interest in the West. This is a cinema, it's a beautiful, beautifully well done, well shot (stutter) movie.  (umm) There's some intense close-ups. (uhh) Sergio Leone is a really excellent director and Clint Eastwood is a  excellent Western hero.  The Good the Bad and the Ugly.	4.83
Corbin here reviewing the two disc  deluxe edition of  Waiting unrated and raw.  This movie is unrated because they added some extra features or some bonus scenes in the movie.  But it was originally rated R.  And Waiting stars Ryan Reynolds who's famous in a lot of movies like Van Wilder,  Blade Three and things like that.  But (uhh) this movie's about  basically working a group of people who work at a restaurant  and basically what goes on throughout the,  you know,  that type of environment.  Personally this movie is okay.  (uhh) There are a lot of comedies  out there nowadays, I don't really think are that funny.  Waiting is one of them.  It's pretty typical. (umm)  Some of my friends who have worked in the food  industry have said that  it's kind of accurate in it's kind of (stutter) it's funny  because they can relate to it cuz that's, you know they worked there.  But from someone who's never worked in the food industry,  I'd say that this really wasn't that funny.  There are a couple funny parts and I'd say it's an average movie it's just not as funny   as it as it as it (stutter) kind of portrays itself as.  But (umm) this is a good set, I'd say I picked it up for six bucks.  But (uhh) it comes with a lot, it comes with a widescreen edition with (stutter) access commentary.  (uhh) The real dish on waiting tables, a (stutter) documentary commentary, deleted scenes,  outtakes, alternate takes.  And trailers.  So that's pretty good.   If you've seen this movie and you like it I recommended but otherwise I think this is a pass.  But (umm)  that's Waiting.	5.477
Hi, I'm Liz and I'm here to talk about The Great New Wonderful.  It's not that great or that wonderful, actually.  The thing about The Great New Wonderful is it's an independent movie, but independent movies that's been around for a while.  And they can't trade on cute and quirky anymore, they need to have some meat to them. There's not a lot of substance to this movie it's just sort of  following a trail of people that are sort of distantly connected to each other through  other characters in the movie and  there's not a lot of payoff at the end. (umm)  I think some of the story some of the (stutter) storylines are tired out, there's  there's (stutter) a psychiatrist who's driving his patient crazy you know, by analyzing him too much. I mean we never we never (stutter) heard that joke before and (umm)  there's just strange things that don't seem to really  mean anything or make any sense, and I think we've moved past that, especially independent film  needs to have more to it than just,  oh look at all this chaos.  Yeah life is chaos, life is boring we know that. It needs to be something some art to it, and there's not a lot of art to this movie I don't think.  (umm) You've got you've got (stutter) a great cast, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Tony Shalhoub, Edie Falco from the Sopranos,  Stephen Colbert, obviously the Colbert Report. (umm) Colbert Report, sorry.  It's it's (stutter) They're all good in their individual ways and yet it doesn't add up to much.  And I think that's the problem this movie, it doesn't really leave you with anything.  So, not recommended.  The Great New Wonderful.	6.403
Hi Expo tv this is Vasily and today I'm going to be reviewing Good Luck Chuck, a movie  I can't say I think wouldn't be bad going into it and I definitely wasn't wrong about that.  (umm) It stars Dane Cook and Jessica Alba and I gotta say it's a pretty horrendous movie.  (umm) Not really that funny, the whole plot was really boring. (umm)  Dane Cook plays Charlie a man who as a six year old goes under a magic spell that  while he'll never find love, every woman that sleeps with him will  go on to become very lucky and find  their true love right after sleeping with him.  And Jessica Alba is just prone to complete tragedy no matter what she does, she's in constant accidents. So the two of them together they're a couple of funny scenes but  all in all it's pretty  horrible like I said. She's (umm)  Cam Wexler  a penguin  (umm) aquarium person she loves taking care of the penguins and  this is really boring and ridiculous so.  Don't recommend seeing it.  And definitely don't buy it or rent when it comes out on DVD.	5.477
Hi Expo TV, I'd like to review a movie currently in theaters that I saw.  This was the movie Fred Claus, starring Vince Vaughn.  (umm) This is pretty much your typical holiday movie.  I wouldn't go to this expecting anything extravagant or mind blowing.  It's gonna be some cheap laughs  (uhh) crummy plot  and that's about it. I wouldn't expect much more I mean,  it's Christmas time. They have to come out with these movies it seems like.  Kind of disappointing that Vince Vaughn is in it cause I thought he was funnier than that. But  if you can get over the fact that it is a crappy holiday movie, you might actually enjoy it  sort of.  (uhh) As you may or may not know the plot is of  Santa Claus' brother  (umm) is also  privileged to live forever like Santa  and  that's pretty much  all you need to know.  (uhh) This movie  not worth the money,  not worth renting  (uhh) really I I (stutter) would not recommend this movie at all.	4.082
Hi, my name is Will and this is my video opinion of the movie Jerry Maguire.  Jerry Jerry (stutter) Maguire is a classic. This movie (umm) has coined a lot of different little sayings like  (uhh) you had me at hello, and (uhh)  Kwon, show me the money, you know those are all like big catchphrases that you still see being parodied today, so  this is definitely a classic movie. (uhh) Needless to say, I loved it.  (umm) You know, Siskel and Ebert gave it two thumbs up. You know, it's about a  (umm) a sports agent  whose you know, trials and tribulations you know, he ends up going off on his own,  you see how that story develops in the movie. And (uhh)  he has a relationship with one of his, you know one of his clients which is Cuba Gooding Junior's character  (umm) and Cuba just does an amazing job in this movie. He is very,  he's he's (stutter) becomes this role and he's very passionate about it.  And the way that both Tom Cruise and Cuba are passionate about their roles it makes for an excellent movie.  (umm) You know it, that's why it won so many  academy awards, you know back in nine, you know ninety-six when it came out.  You know, including (uhh) best supporting actor with (uhh) Cuba Gooding Junior and (uhh)  best actor with Tom Cruise, so.  This is definitely a excellent movie. Needs to be part of your collection, I loved it.	6.164
{movie}  What's up expo? A Mayzark here. Today I'm reviewing The Longest Yard, the original version. This is the one with Burt Reynolds, not with Adam Sandler.  They're very similar but  I like this one better because it's older and Burt Reynolds is  one of my favorite actors. I like him a lot, he's funny. (umm) This movie is very funny so if you like comedies pick it up. (umm)  It's about  these  (stutter) like a big group of guys who are in prison but they get a chance to play on a football field, a football team, and  show what they're really capable of and it gives it just gives (stutter) them an opportunity to do something with themselves  instead of just sitting in jail all day, you know, cause that would suck. But  it's a very good movie, pick it up. It has (stutter) pretty good actors in it. (umm) It's really funny. It's all around a good movie, I give it probably five out of five stars. (umm) Pick it up today at Best Buy or wherever.  (umm)  I would say  that this is one of the the (stutter) better older movies of this generation because this generation  didn't have that many good movies, but  this one is good. So pick it up today. Lates.	2.16
Hey Expo Tv, this is Victor and I have for you  a review on this movie entitled Crazy Beautiful.  It's got  (uhh) Kirsten Dunst and Jay Hernandez and it's a really good movie. It's  (umm) primarily targeted towards like the teenager kind of audience, but the cool thing about this movie is that  it has a really cool soundtrack.  (umm) And and (stutter) it also features one of my all time favorite bands Oskar, in the movie. So I thought that was really cool.  (umm) But, it's a really cool movie because  it's very it's very (stutter) real, you know. You can tell  (umm) I mean, (stutters) you really start to believe in these characters, that they're going through these  (uhh) experiences and stuff and I know that a lot of teenagers in high school can relate to this. It's got you know, a lot of real  kind of stuff you know? I I (stutter) definitely relate to it and so  (umm) Chicago Tribune gave it three stars, but I'm giving it five stars.  It's just I, I, I (stutter) enjoyed the movie I'm not gonna lie. I know it's kind of cheesy but.  Cool movie, it's got Oskar in it, what more could you ask for.	5.972
Hey guys, today I'm reviewing the movie Dogma.  This movie is rated R so you probably do not want to show it to your kids.  (uhh) And it's put out by Sony pictures home entertainment,  and the subtitles that come with it are English, French and Spanish.  (umm)  (uhh) (uhh) There's some good actors in it like Ben Affleck, Matt Damon and Chris Rock, some big name guys.  (umm) Critics gave this movie thumbs up so that's always good.  (umm) This is in a movie series with like, Jay and Silent Bob, Clerks, Clerks two,  so you know it will be funny.  (umm) I got this movie at Walmart, you can get it at Best Buy, Circuit City, Target, Kmart, pretty much anywhere that sells movies.  (uhh) It's a great action comedy movie. It's really funny. (umm)  Yeah, this movie's really good, I definitely recommend it to everyone and,  yeah, just lots of action, lots of funny parts, just everything you want in a movie. Thanks.	3.873
Hello Expo TV.  (umm) This is my review of the movie Sharkwater, it's a documentary about sharks.  (uhh) Surprise surprise.  (uhh) This movie is really good.  (uhh) (stutters) I give it I give it a five out of five. Why not?  Five stars, that's ten but hey.  (uhh) Basically it kind of  tries to break the  (uhh) mindset that sharks are these evil killers  (uhh) just waiting to chomp on your legs when you go swimming.  (uhh) That's personally what I always thought.  (uhh) I don't like to swim in the ocean because I'm afraid a shark's gonna chomp on my leg.  (uhh) this movie kinda  shows you that  (uhh) that's just what we're being conditioned to think and  (uhh) I mean while sharks are still dangerous I don't think they're as dangerous now as  (uhh) I once did and  he kinda shows you the  (uhh) that you don't have to be afraid of sharks.  {clears throat}  Excuse me.  If  if you show them that you're not afraid, then they, they (stutter) don't have to be afraid of you.  (umm) Also, this movie goes on to address the illegal black market  shark trade,  where (uhh) people cut off sharks fins and use em to make shark fin soup and  sell it for you know, a hundred dollars for a bowl of soup  and then leave the shark in the ocean to die with no fin.  So,  that's kinda sad. Kinda flips the script around  and (uhh) puts you on the shark side instead of the typical Jaws perspective where the sharks are trying to kill you.  So, see this movie  for sure.  (uhh) True story, cause it's a documentary  and (uhh) you'll probably be wowed by what you see.	3.317
Good morning expo TV.  I'm Curt and I'm here to review the movie currently in theaters (uhh) the name of it is Redacted  (umm)  This one is kinda a war drama (umm)  set to be based of real events, well supposedly it is (uhh)  about a fourteen year old girl and her family who get murdered in Iraq  (uhh) by U.S. soldiers.  (umm)  This movie wasn't very good. (uhh)  The acting was terrible. (umm)  It's directed by Brian De Palma who directed Scarface so,  I don't know, I don't know a lot about it but I thought Scarface was a pretty good movie so  this should've been good but it was terrible. (uhh)  I would give it two out of five.  I definitely save it for. (uhh)  There's one guy that's like three hundred pounds but somehow he's a specialist  in the army.  That's not very believable unless (uhh) the army has changed. (umm)  There's a southerner guy  that's racist and what not except He doesn't talk like he's from the South he just talks like he's from California. {laughter}  (uhh) so I don't know  I would say it's not very believable.  The acting is bad and (uhh)  don't go see it.	4.69
Hi ExpoTV, my name's Lindsay and I'm here today to talk to you about  Mystery Men the movie on DVD.  This is a very  stupid movie. {laugh} (umm) I really can't say anything great about it at all.  (umm) But it does have quite the star-studded cast though.  (uhh) It has Ben Stiller, Janeane Garofalo, Hank Azaria,  William H. Macy, Greg Kinnear, (umm)  my favorite Paul Reubens,  better known as Peewee Herman,  (uhh) from the Peewee Herman show and all of Peewee's Playhouse and (umm)  Peewee's Big Adventure.  (umm) This is a movie about some unlikely superheroes.  (umm) For example, (uhh) Hank Azaria plays a character called the blue rajah whose superhero power is flinging fork.  It's really bad, (uhh) I really can't recommend this movie at all.  (umm) Dane Cook does make an appearance in it.  (uhh) Before he was famous, it's probably for about five seconds where he is  the waffler.  Yeah, real bad. So  (umm) I don't recommend this movie.  (umm) Unless you're really, really bored.  Don't get it, don't rent it,  just let it go. (umm) So  this does not get my seal of approval, Mystery Men on DVD.  It's real bad.  Can't say anything good.  So (uhh) I hope that you find this review enjoyable  and helpful.  And don't watch Mystery Men.	5.686
Corbitt here, reviewing the movie Reign of Fire. Reign of Fire is a movie starring Matthew McConaughey and Christian Bale and it's about this dragon that's found in the earth and (uhh) basically all hell rains loose when it gets freed, the world is pretty much being destroyed  and (umm)  {sigh} there's not much to say about this movie. You know, I'm a huge fan of both the stars, Matthew McConaughey and Christian Bale. Christian Bale has done a lot of good movies and {sigh} I don't know what happened but (umm)  this isn't that good of a movie.  (umm) You'd think even these two great actors could save it, but that's not the case. (umm) It's just not that good of an action movie. The conversations with the people are just, like,  they don't sound right, they don't sound real. (umm) It seems a little over the top even for having a dragon in it  and (umm)  it's just not that good.  (umm)  Surprisingly with this movie they added a lot of extra features including a making of dragons, a pyrotechnics featurette, (uhh) conversations with the director, a trailer, and surround sound. But (umm) I really wouldn't recommend this. I guess if you're a huge dragon fan you might wanna check it out, but (umm) this definitely a pass for me. Reign of Fire.	5.477
Hi. Today I'm going to be telling you about a movie that I really enjoy, playing in the background behind me, and it's this movie right here Dumb and Dumber. This is the unrated version as you can see, and it's part of the Newline Platinum series. So (uhh) that series has some extra features so if you're interested in some of the production stuff or some of the bloopers and things that weren't included in the theatrical release this is one that you want to check out. (uhh) This DVD retails for fifteen dollars in most stores and I think it's a great deal because like I said you get a film which I really like along with plenty of extras (uhh) to go along with it.  (umm) So this movie I would recommend it to people who are wanting to see a comedy. Stars Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels and they're these two guys who (uhh)  go through a lot of stupid things, as the title might suggest (uhh) and do some really dumb stuff. But it's, it's (stutter) really quite funny and (uhh) it's a really good movie so  (uhh) I'd recommend it to anybody who's looking for a laugh. This particular DVD (umm) I would recommend to anybody who's a fan of the film and a fan of that style of comedy and is looking to get a little bit more than is included with the basic release.  (uhh) This DVD also comes with a DVD-ROM  which I didn't find that helpful. (umm) So if you have a computer you can put it in there and see some additional features that you wouldn't see with the DVD (uhh) player, just a regular DVD player. But I didn't, I didn't (stutter) find anything (uhh) notable in there. (uhh) There is six minutes of additional footage of the film, so there is another reason to buy this (uhh) this particular DVD. So again the movie is Dumb and Dumber. I really like it. If you're looking for a comedy I'd definitely check this one out.	6.055
Hi. I'm Liz, and I'm here to talk to you about  Moonraker.  This is a ridiculous movie. (umm)  It is the eleventh James Bond film,  fourth to star Roger Moore as James Bond.  It is available by itself,  or  as part of the Ultimate Edition Volume Four  in the James Bond Collections, this nice silver one.  It also contains Octopussy, Tomorrow Never Dies,  You Only Live Twice, and Doctor No.  This movie, as I say, is completely ridiculous. It's very loosely based on the novel Moonraker by Ian Fleming.  (umm) It was actually chosen  (uhh)  for release at this moment  (uhh) in time  because of the popularity of Star Wars  (stutter) at the time, had been very recent.  They originally were going to do For Your Eyes Only  as the next film, and they put that off  until after,  because they wanted to get this out there.  That was a really bad idea.  (umm)  The character of Holly Goodhead  yes, that's an actual Bondgirl name,  a lot of people think that's a parody or something from Austin Powers  no  Holly Goodhead, that was her name,  is a complete... (umm)  She's of course a NASA scientist, because   what bond girl wouldn't be?  (uhh)  She is a total invention of the film. There's no such character in the novel, she's completely ridiculous.  Who, who (stutter) on Earth would   have, have (stutter) that name and act like that, I don't know.  (umm)  Apparently, (uhh) she's she's (stutter) quite dull,   (uhh)   the actress who, who (stutter) played the part.  Well, the character's dull.  Presumably, the actress, and  the entire rest of her family are just as dull, because she  claims she's able to convince her grandmother that the name of Goodhead referred to her having a good head  on her shoulders, I don't know.  (umm)  James Bond in Space.  How much more ridiculous can you get?  I saw this movie on TV when I was about ten, but this is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen.  Jaws,  from the Spy Who Loved Me,  (uhh) played by Richard Kiel,  is brought back as like a good guy in this for some reason. I guess he was a popular character and they wanted to reuse him,  and he has like a love interest  with Pigtails, and it's so so very,  oh oh it's just upsetting. (umm)  It's bad.  (stutter) I think there are people who get some sort of sick enjoyment out of this movie, but it's not quite in the so-bad-it's-good category,  especially if you are a James Bond fan, it's very painful to watch this at times.  On the other hand,  if you're a really devoted fan,  you need to own this anyway. (umm)  I wouldn't recommend buying it  unless you're a severe masochist, but again, it does come in the  final (umm)  the final set  of, of (stutter) the James Bond (uhh)  the complete DVD collection, so   you'll probably end up with it anyway if you're a completist like me.  And (umm) you know (ehh) it's alright.  (umm)  You can probably get some enjoyment out of this if you're if you're (stutter) using some very strong hallucinogenic substances  or massive amounts of alcohol.	5.598
Hi ExpoTV.  I'm here to talk about the DVD movie,  Booty Call.  This is actually {laugh} one of my favorite movies  and if you knew me you probably wouldn't think that,  but I really do love this movie.  (umm) It was made in the nineties  and it's stars Jamie Foxx, Tommy Davidson, Vivica A. Fox,  and Tomalia Jones.  (umm) And it's Jamie Foxx before he started taking himself a little  too seriously.  (umm) And you kind, if you knew, if you know (stutter) him now you probably  wouldn't expect him to take on a role like this.  (uhh) It is a comedy  about (uhh) relationships and what men and women want from each other.  And the version that I have is  the bootiest edition.  And it has special features such as (uhh) an alternate ending,  (uhh) film maker commentary, bonus trailers, scene selections,  and the interactive menus which I really like.  So this one gets five stars out of five stars from me,  just because it's absolutely hysterical.  And (umm)  you, you (stutter) just gotta see it to believe it.  (umm) So I hope you go out and buy this movie right away if you can  find it.  And I hope that you find this review enjoyable and helpful.  Have a great day.	6.683
What's up, Expo? This is Seth again. I'm going to be reviewing the DVD three thousand Miles to Graceland. This stars Kurt Russell and (umm) (uhh)  Kevin Costner. And what it is about (umm) two guys that are teamed up to (umm) go make a daring (umm) robbery of a casino in Las Vegas. And the twist is that it's during an Elvis (umm) (uhh) conference. And everybody is dressed up as Elvis. And so (umm) that's exactly what they do. That's what (umm) the whole Graceland part is about.  It's (uhh) so they do, they attempt this daring robbery and then there's some twists and there's some turns. (umm) It is rated R for some strong violence (uhh) during the robbery.  I'm going to show you a clip here.  {movie_63.405_77.974}  It's an okay movie. I'd probably only give it a two out of five stars. (umm) It's not the greatest movie. But two out of five stars. (umm) You might enjoy it one time. (umm) If you're an Elvis fan, you like seeing a bunch of guys dressed up as Elvis, you might like it even more than I do.  So anyways, two out of five stars. (uhh) three thousand Miles to Graceland, Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner. And you guys have a good day.	3.464
Hi expotv, this is Stacy and today I want to tell you about a movie I just saw (uhh) not too long ago, it's Charlie Wilson's (umm) War. Here's my movie stub.  And it is a true story about (umm) a playboy congressman, a CIA agent and a  a beautiful Houston socialite. Basically they join forces to lead the largest and most successful covert operation in history. (umm)  I have no idea what the movie's about.  Seriously.  It was boring.  Hard to follow. Didn't really understand it. (umm) {noise}  I don't know. I didn't like it. I didn't like it at all. It had bad reviews from what I see and,  I mean,  nobody really thought it was gonna make it and I kinda understand why. I wouldn't recommend that you go see it unless you like boring movies, you have nothing else to do, and you really wanna maybe you're having trouble sleeping. This could put you to sleep. Yup, that's that's (stutter) a good idea. If you're having trouble sleeping maybe you should go see it, it'll help you go to sleep and all will be solved, but otherwise don't go to see it.(umm) Very boring.  And actually when I went the movie theater was empty.  That should have given me a hint, I should have walked out and went to something else but I don't know. (umm)  It's got a talented cast but  the movie's story wasn't really there. It's directed by Mike Nichols,  stars Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts. I thought it was gonna be awesome but it it (stutter) just really wasn't. I personally didn't like it so I'm here to let you know I didn't like it so maybe you won't like it either. Don't go see it. This is Stacy and today I told you not to go see Charlie Wilson's War.	6.403
Hi expotv, this is Melissa again, and you can check out my (stutter) (uhh) profile at PM three-two-one to see what I've been reviewing. I'm going to review for you today Mission Impossible Two. It features (uhh) Tom Cruise and (uhh) Thandie Newton as your main  (umm) (uhh) characters there. (uhh) Basically this movie was horrendous, I didn't like it at all, and I was just discussing it with my husband. He was saying that he didn't realize that you could film a whole movie in slow motion and that's basically what the whole thing is like. Everything they just slow down and try to make it dramatic and it just was way too much. If there's a couple scenes of that, okay, but not everything. It just was horrible, definitely a one out of five.  However you do have some good special features if you like to watch the special features on things. (umm) You have Behind the Mission: exclusive cast and crew interviews, mission incredible stunts, you have impossible shots, commentaries by the director, (umm)  you have the Metallica music video, alternate title sequence, (umm) mission improbable a mission (umm)  impossible two inspired parody from the MTV movie awards. That was good to watch, I do admit. (umm) Tease trailer, big game watch TV spot,  tribute montages, and then (umm) lots of other stuff. So there are a lot of extra things to watch which might make up for you the fact that the movie is horrible. So I don't know what you think, check it out.	5.598
Hi, this is my review for the movie Napoleon Dynamite.  Which I love but I mean there's some people that love it and some people that hate it, so  (uhh) you'll just have to see if you're one of those, I would definitely recommend seeing it though.  (uhh) I loved it (uhh) the second time I saw it and a lot of people  I've talked to said the same thing, like the first time  they were just like wow this is  kind of weird {laugh} but the second time you really get into it and  it's just a lot of fun.  (umm) Napoleon Dynamite is a new kind of hero  complete with a tight fro, sweet moon boots and skills that can't be topped,  Napoleon spends his days drawing mythical beasts, dunking it out with his brother Kip, and avoiding his scheming uncle Rico.  When two new friends enter Napoleon's life, shy Deb and mustachioed Pedro,  the trio launches a campaign to elect Pedro for class president and make the student body's wildest dreams come true.  But if Pedro is to be stuck of summer, Napoleon will have to unleash his secret weapon.  (umm) It's rated PG, so it's really  very clean and (umm) it is  how many minutes, ninety-five minutes long.  And so like I said, some people I know love it and some hate it, so  but it's definitely worth a watch. Thanks.	3.742
{noise}  Hi ExpoTV my name is Lindsey and I am here today to talk to you about the DVD movie A Clockwork Orange.  This is a movie that was directed by Stanley Kubrick based on a book (uhh) by (umm)  (uhh) Anthony Burges and it was definitely made in the seventies as you can tell by the  weird outfits that they are wearing  and it's kind of a strange movie if you are like me, you have to have somebody explain it to you  and then you still didn't understand it  so  that means a little weird (umm) these guys in the Clockwork Orange,  they speak their own language,  they drink milk,  it's really weird and it's awful violent also so which I really didn't care for  (umm) so I really  don't say I can, I can't (stutter) recommend this movie (uhh)  I am going to give it one star out of five stars (uhh)  but I know it's a cult classic and a lot of people like this movie so  hey you may like it but it's not for me  (umm) but again (umm)  my review is on Stanley Kubrick,  Clockwork Orange and I hope you find this review helpful.  {noise}	5.354
Hello. Today I'm reviewing Munich  directed by Steven Spielberg, starring Eric Bana and Daniel Craig (uhh) from the most recent double-oh-seven movie. (uhh) This movie basically is about (uhh) the nineteen-seventy-two (uhh) Olympic massacre of the Israeli (umm)  Olympians. (uhh) There were eleven of them that were assassinated and  Eric Bana's character (stutter) and a group of (umm) other Israeli soldiers are hired to go and track down the Palestinians (uhh) that are believed to have killed (uhh) these eleven athletes. (umm) And it's really that story (umm) from cradle to grave. It works it from the very beginning all the way through. (umm) I got to say for this to be a Steven Spielberg movie I wasn't really thrilled with it. (umm) Again (stutter) maybe it's just I didn't get it. (uhh) But it was definitely praised by the critics, it actually got (uhh) five Academy Award nominations (umm) when it came out.  I didn't like it. (uhh) That doesn't mean that you won't like it, it just means that I didn't like it. I would not recommend this one though. (umm) It's long, it's drawn out, it takes a long time to even get started. (umm) If you like to see random things blow up, well this one might be for you but I I (stutter) really didn't see much plot in it. Very slow. (umm) So I would not recommend this one. Thank you.	5.26
Hello, I'm reviewing the movie Men of Honor, starring Cuba Gooding Junior and Robert De Niro.  (uhh) This movie is about a an (stutter) African American Navy sailor who wants to be a Navy master diver played by Cuba Gooding Junior.  Of course he meets a lot of resistance  (umm) by he meets a lot of resistance because he wants to do this and it just wasn't accepted  (umm) back then unfortunately and (uhh) Robert De Niro is actually  (uhh) his commanding officer and just puts him through  (umm) hell.  (umm) Just gives him  (uhh) everything you can throw at him, he throws at him  (uhh) trying to make him quit. He doesn't want him to win.  (umm) He does come around in the end though. It's really really a heart warming story. Really glad  (umm) to see this story being told.  (umm) It is based on a true story.  (uhh) The guy played  (uhh) by Cuba Gooding Junior is a real  (uhh) man and he was a real sailor.  (umm) So great to see his story told.  (uhh) There are some bonus features on this one. We have an alternate ending,  (uhh) some deleted scenes, some commentary, some behind the scenes footage and even a featurette on the real sailor  (umm) that Cuba Gooding Junior plays. So definitely a feel good movie. Definitely a great movie that you're gonna wanna add to your collection.	5.686
Hi this is Dan with my review of The Namesake available on DVD.  This movie tracks the story of two generations of  Indian Americans that (uhh) basically  believe their homeland to come to America.  (umm) The father and mother have two  (umm) children a son and a daughter here in America and they try to identify  basically who they are and how they fit in in this culture.  The (uhh) generation divide and also with cultural issues are illustrated in this movie.  And (umm) unfortunately this serious theme drags on for quite a long time.  And (uhh) unless you have great interest in this subject, I  frankly lost a bit of interest rather quickly so  (uhh) it wasn't the best movie to me.  In my opinion I, I (stutter) only give it two out of five stars.  The Namesake does tackle a  serious topic and (umm)  it does a good job portraying life although kind of depressingly  as our main character  (umm) struggles in life to find out who he is and how he fits in.  The Namesake (umm)  is rated PG-thirteen and (umm)  generally pretty benign of a movie (uhh)  so available on DVD.  (uhh) I again recommend it with two of five stars. This ends my review of The Namesake.	5.354
Hello, today I'm reviewing the movie A Bronx Tale, starring Robert De Niro and (stutter) Chazz Palmintiri. (uhh) This movie is actually the directorial debut (uhh) by Robert De Niro. (umm) It's classic De Niro in the fact that it's kind of got a mafia overlay in everything that's going on. (uhh) Essentially Chazz Palmintiri is a crime boss and Robert De Niro is a bus driver, so you have two opposite sides of the tracks and in between these two gentlemen is Robert De Niro's son who is seeing the best of both worlds. (umm) He has his father that has everyone's respect because he earned it, but he has to work hard for it and he sees the crime boss who  has everybody's respect because they're all scared to death of him. (umm) So he gets to see both sides of the story and has to make a decision on which way he's gonna go with it. (umm) It's a very very good movie. (umm) One that kind of makes you think. (uhh) you can sit back, you can enjoy it and for a directorial debut it's definitely impressive on the side of Robert De Niro. (umm) A couple of bonus features, not a whole lot. (uhh) Just some cast bios, (uhh) it's dubbed in multiple language and (uhh) multiple languages and (uhh) it has the original theater trailer. (uhh) So nothing big there, just a couple of things. But definitely one that you want to add to your collection, especially if you are a gangster (uhh) movie fan. This one's gonna pull five out of five stars for me.	6.351
Hey ExpoTV it's Kristin. This is my review for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie.  And this movie that came out in  I'm not sure, I think it's like  (umm) this says nineteen-ninety, I don't know I thought it was a little bit before that.  That would have made me four, I thought I was younger than that but anyway.  Okay, (umm)  this is probably the best. I don't know, this one and the second one are tied. (umm)  Being the best turtle movies.  This one has the original April who was never seen again, a different person plays April in the second and third movies.  (umm) This is the first time we meet Casey Jones. (umm)  I don't know, just good. It just continues along with the cartoon, TV show, and the comics. (umm)  It tells their whole history of how they came to be  the teenage mutant ninja turtles. (umm)  They fight Shredder their,  you know ultimate enemy. They meet up with April and Casey who help them out. (umm)  It doesn't stray too far from the original story which is probably why it's so good.  Because that's the story that everyone likes, which is the reason they want to go see the movie the first time,  the, in the first place. But (umm)  yeah, (umm)  it has a pretty good song by MC Hammer at the end  during the credits. (umm)  Check it out.	2.16
Hi. I'm here to review the movie Klute,  starring Donald Sutherland and Jane Fonda. (uhh) This is a movie about a  call girl (umm)  I'd say the time is the nineteen-seventies. (umm)  She's (uhh)  getting harassing letters  from a former client. (umm)  This man (uhh) had very strong (uhh)  economic connections and his  family former business partners are trying to find out if he is still alive and just what is going on and why this call girl (uhh)  has has (stutter) remained some kind of access to him. Donald Sutherland plays the private detective, Klute, who they hire to find out just what is going on. (uhh)  This movie was hailed at the time as a masterpiece and a breakout movie (umm)  but I found it  (uhh) kind of   long and talky and (umm)  slow to get into. (uhh) Possibly the  stunning breakout  aspects of this movie was the frankness  with which Jane Fonda discusses her career with her psychiatrist. (uhh) Maybe it was something earthshaking at the time. (uhh)  A good performance by Jane Fonda and Donald Sutherland but I really can't give it a  strong recommendation.	3.697
Hi. Today I'm reviewing the DVD movie Sweet November.  This movie is a romantic movie. It stars Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron, and Charlize Theron plays a woman who just kind of wants to escape through life, escape to relationships, not having any strings attached. (umm) So she invites men into her life for one month only and Keanu Reeves just happens to be her November man and (umm)  well  it's kind a cheesy romantic movie. I really didn't enjoy it that much. (umm) A lot of parts of it were very predictable and (umm)  I  for the most part like romantic movies, but this one I just thought it was really a little bit too cheesy. (umm)  It it's (stutter) just really, really predictable. You can't, I mean,  like most romantic movies (umm)  not really a lot to (umm) the plot and I just really didn't enjoy it that much. So (umm) if you're a real sap and really like romantic movies, any kind, then  check it out. But if not then don't waste your time. Sweet November.	4.83
Hi, my name is Anaj and today I'm reviewing the DVD of the movie Borat. Now this is a movie about this (uhh) journalist from Kazakhstan, Borat, who comes to USA to make this (uhh) documentary and to, you know, learn everything about USA. The problem is that (uhh) he's drunk, you know, he's really  close minded and, you know, he does not, he  did not expect what he sees in US now, you know, he's so conservative and so  (umm)   (stutter) kind of old thinker. And so like in this particular scene he's (uhh) taking a driving (uhh) school (uhh) (stutter) session and again, you know, he cannot understand what to do and what not and that's what makes the movie all funny. (uhh)  I'll tell the story is (uhh) that, you know, he watches Baywatch and (stutter) in the starting of the movie and (uhh) really falls for Pamela Anderson and now he changes all his plans, and he wants to go to California to talk to Pamela Anderson  and the good thing is there is (uhh) actually a special   (umm) appearance of Pamela Anderson in this movie too. (uhh) Not for everyone because there's a lot of (uhh) abusive language also and (uhh) (uhh)  there are things that some Americans may not like, because, you know, it's   the Kazakhstany thinking or something. (uhh) But still very funny if you go with a open mind you'll enjoy this movie a lot, you know. So grab the DVD, watch it.  (uhh)  For this particular style of movie I'll actually rate this movie five on five because I don't like documentary movies and the style in which this movie is made is documentary, but  it's still so nicely done and it's really funny and the actor, you know, he's a big mustache and wearing coat, old style coat all the time, it's just funny. So get the DVD, watch it, I'm sure you'll love it. Borat.	5.0
Good evening, ExpoTV. Tonight I'm going to be reviewing the DVD three hundred. Right here, I have the two-disc special edition. It's a very good movie. It's a story (uhh) about {sigh} King (stutter) Leonidas and (uhh) his battle with three hundred Spartan warriors. It's a titanic crash and (uhh) definitely makes for a good movie.  (umm) Pete Hammond from Maxim says it's a "spectacular visual feast that is inventive and groundbreaking." Those are noble words about a movie right there. (umm) Like I said, it's about King Leonidas taking on three hundred Spartans.  We have some special features here. We have additional scenes that (uhh) they're going to say, you also have commentary with those scenes. They're going to tell you why they don't have those scenes in the movie, why they made the scenes originally, but didn't end up putting them in the movie.  We also have Frank Miller's vision realized on film with three hundred Spartans. Fact or fiction. The shocking life of a Spartan. And actual Spartan, they tell you about the life of them.  We also have Who Were the Spartans? A little look into how they how they (stutter) casted for the characters that play the Spartans in this movie. This movie is rated R. It's got some graphic battle sequences throughout and some sexuality and nudity. Not stuff you're going to want your kids seeing. It's a bloody mess at points. There's sexual stuff going on. Definitely a good movie for adults, though.  I'm going to rank it one of the best out there. I'm going to give it five out of five stars. I'm going to suggest that you definitely pick up three hundred. Do not forget those words. Get three hundred, ExpoTV.	6.351
Hey expotv, Nick B here. Tonight I'm going to be reviewing the DVD Darkness Falls. Here on the cover it says an eye for an eye, your life for a tooth. It's exactly what this movie's all about. (umm)  It's stupid. It's it's (stutter) as dumb as it can get, not scary, not, not (stutter) even remotely good. What they did here is they took the tooth fairy and they made the tooth fairy evil. They made it so that if you open your eyes and see the tooth fairy when she's coming to get your tooth she's going to haunt you for the rest of the (stutter) your life and try to kill you. She's going to keep at it until she does kill you and (stutter) pretty much in the end just make you demented. I don't like it. I don't like trying to take some sweet little children's character and turn it into something evil. I don't think it's right. I think whoever did this must be sick and twisted and really doesn't deserve to be making movies, and if I could I'd put an end to it. We have some special features here. We have filmmaker commentaries, we have the legend of Mathilda Dixon who in the movie is the tooth fairy, we have deleted scenes, we have a storyboard, we have mastered in high definition that's widescreen of fullscreen here on this DVD. We have audio in English and French Dolby digital five point one surround, we have subtitles in English and French, we have animated menus, we have a scene selection. This movie's PG-thirteen, I I (stutter) would rate this movie suck.  I wouldn't see it, I wouldn't waste your time, I wouldn't waste your money, I wouldn't waste that little speck of your life that you're going to lose by seeing a movie where they make the tooth fairy evil. I give it zero out of five stars. I'm going to say don't see it.  Thanks expotv, take my word for it.	7.0
Hi, I'm Valerie and today I'm going to be reviewing the movie Fred Claus.  (umm) It's currently out in theaters and it's about this guy named Fred and he is Santa Claus's brother. And it's around the holiday times when everyone's getting ready for Christmas and they're getting all their toys set and  (umm) so they have their little family get togethers and  (umm) Fred doesn't really get along with anybody really. He thinks the whole situation is silly. So  he kind of (uhh)  steps in one day and looks after things at the North Pole and then it turns into this big party and everything goes kind of crazy  havocy and  so, Santa Claus's brother doesn't really like that too much and  so  I don't know. It's (uhh)  it's kind of a kid movie. I personally didn't really like it. I would rate it a  two out of five.  (umm) It seemed like he was just trying too hard I guess. But if you're a really young kid you may find it entertaining and nice. But  (umm) not my type of Christmas movie. So, that's Fred Claus. (uhh) Go check it out, if you want.  (umm) Alright.	1.414
Hi Expo this is Nicki.  This is my review on (stutter) Johnson Family Vacation  movie. (umm)  I thought this  was not all that great. (umm) I expected a lot more out of it. (umm)  Especially with Cedric the Entertainer.  And don't get me wrong, there's some funny parts in it.  But overall, I think my expectations of it really were a lot higher than  what I got. (umm)  It's rated PG-thirteen for crude humor,  so forth. (umm)  And it's ninety-six minutes long. (umm) I think towards the end I was just really hoping it would end pretty quick. (umm)  It's (umm)  got Bow Wow, Steve Harvey, (uhh) Cedric the Entertainer, (umm) Vanessa Williams, just to name a few of the actors that are in this movie.  But (umm)  I, I (stutter) mean I would check it out it's not a bad movie, I'd probably give this a two and a half. (umm)  But (uhh)  some funny parts in it,  so check it out.  Thanks.	5.354
Hi Expo, this is Melissa again.  You can check out my profile and my reviews at pm three two one. Today we are talking about the movie Naked Gun. (uhh) with Leslie, Leslie (stutter) Nielsen.  This is brought to you by (stutter) the creators of The Police Squad, The Zucker Brothers.  This is just like slapstick comedy (umm)  type of comedy that I hate. I hate this movie, I absolutely hate it. (umm) I'd give it a one out of five. My husband would give it a five out of five because he absolutely loves it. He thinks it's the funniest thing and I just am not that into it. (umm)  basically it's just, to me stupid comedy (umm) with stupid scenes (uhh) It there's to me I wouldn't buy this movie. You have to like that type of sense of humor. (uhh) There are some special features that come with the Naked Gun movie. (umm) Widescreen version  English subtitles scene selection theatrical trailer group commentary with David Zucker, (uhh) Robert Weiss the producer, and Peter Tilden the host (uhh) and there's interactive menus. So there's not a whole lot to this one. You can probably pick it up for about five dollars at your big box store. But I wouldn't waste the five dollars on it, I think it's horrible. Thank you.	6.055
Hi expo. This is Melissa. You can check out my profile, my reviews, to see what I've been talking about lately at PM three two one. Today we are checking out  Naked Gun Two and a Half: The Smell of Fear. Leslie Nielson is back and in action with this horrible comedy because I hate  the Naked Gun series, I just think it's horrendous. It's (uhh) by the Zucker brothers, it's a slapstick comedy so if you like that comedy you'll love this if you haven't seen it. I personally am not a huge fan of it. Basically  Leslie Nielson plays Lieutenant Frank Drebin and he loves a myster, mystery (stutter). He asks these questions. Why are we here? Is there life after sex? Big issues, you know. And (uhh) the biggest of all is how to stop a devious Quentin Hapsburg (umm) his plan to destroy the environment.  And basically we have Priscilla Presley as June, the woman who can melt a cheese sandwich within twenty pieces, George Kennedy as the intrepid Captain Ed Hawkin, and the gang's all here all from the Police Squad files. So if you haven't seen this you might want to pick it up it's about five dollars at your big box box (uhh) store. I give it (uhh) give it a one out of five because I personally hate this type of comedy. So thank you very much.	6.055

This is the  (laughter) Bueller Bueller (stutter) Edition, and (umm) Matthew Broderick stars as Ferris Bueller, and it basically chronicles his (uhh) day of playing hookey, and (uhh) ditching school with his girlfriend and best friend, and (uhh) all the capers that he has to   (uhh) set up to,  (uhh) pull this off without getting caught.

Hi, this is my review of the Disney Pixar movie Ratatouille.  (umm)  Bought this (uhh)  for my kids and  really thought that (uhh) wasn't going to be one of my favorite Pixar movies. I thought, you know, it's about a rat and really didn't look real exciting to me but (uhh) watched it with them and actually really, really enjoyed it. Thought it was very funny, very cute, (umm) very enjoyable family movie. (uhh) I was really pleased. It (umm) had the great (umm) Disney Pixar animations and (uhh) characters were all really well done and the voices were good and the (umm) computer animation was great. (umm) I really liked the story, it had a really cute ending and I just really liked how everything (uhh) was played out and (uhh) the way they did things. (umm) So, you know, it was really, really cute movie. All three of my kids liked it and watched it. (umm) They're two, five, and seven and they all enjoyed it. It's (uhh) rated G and it's a hundred and eleven minutes long. (umm) That's a pretty good  length of a movie. (umm) Kept them all really entertained and I really liked watching it with them so it's definitely one that I would recommend for everybody to watch together and we'll probably watch it several times. (umm) I purchased it at Best Buy for about (uhh) it's probably around fifteen ninety-nine or so. (umm) So I definitely recommend (uhh) Disney Pixar Ratatouille.	3.559
Hello, my name is Sarah and I'll be doing my video opinion for the movie Arctic Tale. (umm)  basically the movie is a real life adventure, (umm) you know, a life in the eyes of a polar bear. (umm) and it also talks about a baby walrus. (umm) you know, so it basically goes through the struggles of survival that each arctic creature has to go through. (umm) you know, being a small (uhh) baby polar bear with, you know, the the (stutter) necessities you need in order to survive. How to feed yourself, how to keep yourself safe from any predators, you know, things like that. (umm) and with the baby walrus, you know, it you going to learn how to feed you going to learn how to be able to you know depend on yourself when your mother's not around. (umm) so that was was (stutter) very cool but this movie is just a real life, you know, message in here of survival you know whether it's an arctic creature or even a human, you know, what you need to accomplish in order to to (stutter) pretty much to survive so (umm) I really enjoyed this movie. (umm) It also reminded me of March of the Penguins so, you know, if you like those type of documentaries that describe real life adventures for real animals (umm) I think you'll really enjoy this one. So I enjoyed it and I think you will too, take a look at Arctic Tale.	5.0
Hello and welcome to my review of the movie at the theater (uhh) Bee Movie. (uhh) this is an animated film done by Jerry Seinfeld and (umm)  apparently Jerry Seinfeld was working on this movie for a few years, (uhh) since he's been finished with the Seinfeld show and so I was expecting a lot more out of this movie. (uhh) overall I was very disappointed in the movie. (uhh)  I thought it would be more along the lines of maybe a Shrek where it would be a movie that the kids would like but the adults would like too. (uhh) however it's much more for the kids which was really surprising (uhh) considering it was Jerry Seinfeld (uhh) Chris Rock. Another thing I didn't like about the movie is (uhh) it was kind of billed in the previews that Chris Rock was, you know, the co-star  of the movie but I mean he literally probably has  ten lines in the entire film and (uhh) just nothing earth shattering so (uhh)  overall I was very disappointed in Bee Movie. (uhh) your kids may like it but (uhh) it it's (stutter) just not a movie for adults, there's no you know a lot of kid's movies are do some clever things that (uhh) you know some double entendres, you know, things like adult humor slid into a kid's movie. There's just not enough of that here so overall I would not recommend seeing Bee Movie.	5.354
Hey. I want to do a (umm) DVD review on one of my favorite films, one of my all-time favorite films, which is Evil Dead two (uhh) Dead By Dawn. And (uhh) this is not your typical horror film. (uhh) The theme for the (stutter) film is Kiss your nerves goodbye. And what's funny about it is (uhh) when I first rented it, I thought it was going to be very scary, but it's (uhh)  it's an original film. I'll give it that. It's awesome because it's (uhh) it's like a horror-comedy.  (umm) It stars Bruce Campbell, which plays the main character, Ash. He (uhh) takes his girlfriend to a secluded cabin to spend the weekend and has found that the cabin has already been, has been (uhh)  I guess vacant with a previous party, and (umm) they have a book there called The Necronomicon, The Book of the Dead. And (umm) supposedly, the (uhh) person there was a scientist and was translating and he opened the portal to the land of the dead and, which also had the demons to come through and possess his wife. And (uhh)  the demons come back. They haunt, and not only haunt but also really just taunt (uhh) Bruce Campbell. They take his girlfriend. And there's funny scenes in the film, you know, like when his hand gets possessed. His hand is breaking pots and (uhh) hitting himself in the head with pots and breaking plates over his head and, you know, it's (uhh)  it's got some awesome scenes in it. It's a cult classic. And (uhh) it's just, it's an awesome film. If you haven't seen this, you really need to. And, again, this is a DVD review for Evil Dead two.	5.745
Well hello expotv land, it's me Danny Ericson and I'm here to talk to you about the new movie in theaters  Alien Versus Predator: Requiem. Now this is the sequel to the  movie Alien Versus Predator which came out a couple years ago  and when I watched that movie I was kind of excited because I'm a fan of the Alien movies and the Predator movies  and I was very disappointed by that, so I'm not sure why I watched the second one but I was still  surprisingly even more disappointed.  (umm) It does include the characters the Aliens from the Alien movies and the Predator from the Predators movies but once again it's just  pointless seeming. I didn't really understand why they were fighting each other. It was rated R, (umm) compared to the last one which was rated only PG-thirteen and it had a lot more blood. So if you're into (umm) a lot of gore that's really pointless I guess you'd like this movie but overall I didn't really see a point in watching it because  it just didn't seem like there was {laugh} any point to it. So I regretted watching it but  I hope you don't make the same mistake.	5.354
Hi. Today I'm reviewing the DVD of the movie Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.  The Last Crusade was supposed to be, of course, the final adventure of Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. That's no longer true since the fourth film is being released this summer. Nevertheless, the Last Crusade returns to the original sense of magic and fun that you found in Raiders of the Lost Ark, magic that was lost somewhat during Temple of Doom. (uhh) maybe it's because the Nazis return as the primary villains of the story, or maybe it's because of the return of greater supporting characters like Sallah and Doctor Marcus Brody. (umm)  The Last Crusade also introduces River Phoenix as the young Indiana Jones who begins his archaeological career at thirteen (uhh) and finds his first use of the bullwhip and his trademark Fedora. Also joining the cast is Sean Connery who is fantastic as Professor Henry Jones, father of Indiana. The chemistry that the two have as father and son is remarkable and you really come away believing that Connery was only about twelve years older than Harrison Ford, is the father who was almost never there. The plot of the film finds Indiana Jones recruited by an American businessman who is trying to find the legendary Holy Grail. The businessman has already recruited Jones' father who has disappeared in the quest. Jones agrees and so begins the great adventure. The movie xxx the magic and fond of Raiders of the Lost Ark and is a great return to form for the film series. I give the movie itself five out of five stars. And the DVD contains no special features since it was released as part of The Adventures of Indiana Jones Collection which has an entire disc of bonus features.	2.708
Hello expotv land. It's me, Danny Ericson, and I'm here to talk to you today about the movie currently in theaters Meet the Spartans. And I don't know (stutter) why I did, but I went to this movie cause I knew I would hate it, cause I hate all movies like this. Like exactly what the Scary Movies have become, the last three-hundred they made, and  things like The Comebacks. They're just all these lame attempts that just keep on referencing movies over and over and they're just not even funny. Like, they just have, I just don't know how they come up with them, they're not funny. Meet the Spartans was just the same way. (umm) They're talking about the Three-Hundred and really they just keep on bringing up things that aren't funny. They're all trying to make this topical humor like Britney Spears, just all this ridiculous stuff that doesn't make sense and isn't, just not funny. I don't know why they keep on making these kinds movie and  I just hope they don't make more movies like this, cause  Three-Hundred just came out last year and they already made a parody of it. I just don't know. These people seem to not have anything else to do with their time. I just don't like it and I hope they don't keep on making more like this.  Don't watch Meet the Spartans.	6.055
Hello expotv, today I'd like to warn you about Trick or Treat. This movie is a terrible waste of your time on many levels.  First off we see Ozzy Osbourne and Gene Simmons on the cover pretty big. Their names nice bold and white.  These men each have less than a minute of screen time and very few lines. (uhh)  This movie is just stupid and terrible. It's about a record that is the last recording of some rock star who dies and some kid gets his hands on it and through some  circus of events, I don't know, the rock star comes back to life as an evil ghost rock star. And he starts trying to kill people and he tries to set a high school on fire or something. (uhh) It doesn't have a good story at all and the acting's terrible, and you know a movie sucks when the best they can do is try and pull the two big names out of it and put them on the front cover to trick you. (uhh) Even the back sucks. They have pictures of people working on completing special effects. These guys are painting a monster used in the movie. They didn't even have his hands. So you can't come up with a really cool scene from a movie to put on the back of the box? You have to use special effects guys giggling as they paint a monster? Stay away. There is (uhh) supposedly a remake of this coming out and  I would be just as wary of it as I am of this (uhh) version  because it's just it's just (stutter) horrible. It's terrible and  I {sigh} I would just, if anybody says "hey we should watch Trick or Treat" you should probably not be friends with them anymore. I kind of just keep this copy around so if people are around and they be like "oh, hey what's -" no, if you ever see that you should run the other way because it is just the worst idea ever.	4.69
Hey Expo TV, this is Kevin and this is my review on Elf, starring Will Ferrell. (umm)  It's not like a weird movie for me because (uhh) a lot of people didn't seem to like it. I don't know if it's because (uhh) it's not the typical Will Ferrell we're used to seeing. (umm) But I really found a lot of humor in it and I thought it was really funny and a great family movie and (uhh) great for the holidays too. It's a Christmas movie. (uhh) Holidays are coming around. Definitely wanna wanna (stutter) go check it out. This particular DVD (umm) has the widescreen and the full screen editions in there and (uhh)  a lot of (uhh) bonus features and stuff. Games and stuff for the kids. (umm) (stutters) Behind the scenes (uhh) special (umm) like deleted scenes and stuff like that. Great movie though. (uhh) Definitely not the Will Ferrell we're used to seeing. (uhh) He's toned it down for the kids I guess. (uhh) You know, I think that really shows something about his character. He's (uhh) he's a great actor and (uhh) definitely a great movie. So (uhh) don't be hesitant, to be oh it's Will Ferrell, we can't let the kids watch it. But it's definitely a good family movie and I definitely recommend it. So (uhh) go check it out and (umm) I'm sure you'll like it.	4.83
What's up guys I am going to review a movie that I think and actually many people agree with me (uhh) critics and fans alike that is one of or maybe the best war movie (umm) ever made and it's called Saving Private Ryan it stars Tom Hank's of course (umm)  Matt Damon and a cast of others including Vin Diesel if you're a fan of his and it's about (umm)  you know a setting in World War Two and a mother who has lost three of her four sons in the war, so there is one squadron's mission to go and find the fourth son whose name is Private Ryan (umm) the movie goes through that it goes through the realities of war and World War Two what happened there and what happened to them (umm) It's seen through the eyes of these soldiers you know they question their orders they don't understand why they have to risk their life (umm)  Ryan questions his orders he just wants to stay and fight for his country (umm)  and really just goes through their struggles of your your (stutter) everyday you know American soldier in World War Two, and it's poignant and it's beautiful, and you know it won five academy awards including best director Steven Spielberg of course you know it's hailed by everybody Time Magazine, USA Today, New York Times, Entertainment Weekly, (umm) it won best picture award at the the (stutter) Toronto broadcast film critic special. It just it's really a beautiful movie (uhh) most people have seen it and agree it's the best one ever made if you haven't, if you're a war movie buff (umm) if you love history, all of the above for me, or if you just want to watch a good movie pick up Saving Private Ryan because you will not regret it.	6.055
Hello, ExpoTV users. I am here to review a movie that is currently in theaters called Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns. This movie, it has a good heart. It's about family and love and drama and has some (stutter) comedy. It's basically the story about a single mother raising her children, and she really wants to keep her kids off the street, obviously. But she gets fired from her job and begins to get hopeless. And then she finds out that a father, her father that she never even knew existed, had died. So she decides to take her family from Chicago down to Georgia for the funeral. And she meets a whole family she never knew existed.  Basically, it has some touching scenes. It has, does have some funny scenes. But all in all, it seems like he's trying too hard. If you're a Tyler Perry fan, you may enjoy this movie, although I don't even like this one as much as his others and I didn't even like the others too much. It's based on a play of the same name, and, I don't know, I wouldn't really waste my money unless you're a big fan of his. Bye.	4.967
Hi I'm Tom and today I'm gonna be reviewing the movie ten thousand BC. As validation here is my movie ticket which kinda got crumpled in my pocket I apologize.  There we go, yeah, front pocket. (umm)  Okay this movie bothered me a lot just because it was really not historically accurate. But I don't know if they were trying to set out for that but that's the part that just confuses me. (uhh) Special effects were great but the cast that, you knew nobody. (umm)  It it's (stutter) a good movie.  It it (stutter) follows the story of this   (stutter) mammoth hunter and it, trying to do better for his tribe, or trying to get his tribe a better life. (umm) It's got a lot of really good action. They were trying to push this as a like, the next big epic movie just like three hundred but no it didn't come anywhere close and the best part is, if you (uhh) look back to the release dates, three hundred was released the same weekend just a year prior to it. (umm) So I think that's what they were really trying to push for was like the same audience, the same, oh this is going to be huge and epic.  It wasn't that good. (uhh) Three hundred was completely epic, this if if (stutter) you want a comparison just three hundred here, ten thousand BC here. (umm)  I would rent this one or maybe ask for it for like a holiday present just so I don't have to spend money on it. But the special effects are great, historically accurate no.  I'm going to give this a two out of five. Thanks.	5.066
Hi I'm reviewing the movie in theaters, Step Up Two the Streets. This is a sequel to the earlier dance movie Step Up. And this is a dance movie as well. It has (uhh) a decent-ish plot, basically it has (uhh) a street dancer so to speak, who's a part of a kind of gang of dancers. It's kind of odd honestly, this whole like street coupled with dance situation. (uhh) But she decides that she doesn't just wanna be a street dancer she wants to go to the elite Maryland School of the Arts. So she manages to get in there and she gets together with this other fellow who is sent over there who is like the lead dancer in the school and they start their own little thing. But there's a lot of rivalry between like the street gang and the school gang and at one point one of them is actually beaten up.  So this basically for anyone who's gonna go watch this movie, if you're really into like dance movies and you like watching dancing it could be decent for that. Plotwise it's honestly kind of weak, has a little bit of racist overtones as well. So it's not a great movie but again if you like watching the dancing it could be for you. Bye.	4.203
Hi. I am here to review a movie that is currently in theaters called Boarding Gate. They should call it boring gate because that's really what it is. It's basically a waste of your time. The premise of this story is that there's an ex-prostitute Sandra, living in London and after an encounter with one of her ex's. The whole xxx and xxx thing going on which ends in violence. She is forced to flee from England to Hong Kong.  Now in Hong Kong she meets people she thinks are her friends, they promise to help her out and get her all her papers and her visas and all that and  drugs are involved and are these people are friends after all? Or is it just a whole big manipulative thing? The plot line is pretty empty. (umm) I talked to some of my friends that seen it and they were also just not impressed. So if you have a couple of hours that you just want to waste and I mean waste, then go check it out. Have a good day. Bye.	6.055
{noise} Hi there and welcome to my review of the nineteen-sixty-one best picture of the year, West Side Story. This is the DVD collector's set. (umm) Like I said this film came out in nineteen-sixty-one and is not even rated but it's definitely suitable for all audiences and one of my favorite films. The (uhh) two disc edition is actually kind of nice. It comes with, it comes in that little case there. (umm) It comes with this book here which is has (uhh) the entire script including the lyrics to the songs, which is kind of nice. (umm) As well as (umm) two discs of (uhh) many special features. (umm)  This (stutter) or this (uhh) movie is also a musical which I kind of enjoy and find myself singing along. (umm) I have seen this show many times in my career {laugh} and it involves kind of a modern day Romeo and Juliette as (umm)  Maria and Tony are from different gangs, the Jets and the Sharks. (umm) Puerto Rican gangs in New York City and (umm) kind of absurd romance ensues and (umm) I don't know, the interaction between the two gangs cause they're from the different side of the tracks. So I recommend that you buy the two (stutter) disc edition of West Side Story.	5.745
Expotv, let's talk about Nim's Island. Alright, now, it's a kid's movie okay? But now overall though kid's movies usually are pretty good overall, like as movies. This movie was not. Let me tell you why, alright? Now,  well the acting was good, especially Abigail Breslin. That was the only good thing about the movie. Now other times it's just like the story line wasn't that good for a kid's movie, you know? Normally you can go see a kid's movie no matter what age you are and love it. Like, I mean, all Disney stuff, everything. Pixar, whatever. This one just it just didn't have that many elements. I mean there definitely was not like any like adult humor, you know, that only adults get and stuff.  (stutter) I don't even know if kids would like it. It's just, I mean it's a really fantasy movie, there's a lot of like weird stuff. I mean that's cool but Jodie Foster doesn't do a great job, you know, so the only good thing about the acting is Abigail Breslin. And like some of the camera work is just like oh this is horrible. I mean on a on a (stutter) scale of like stars I would give it definitely like two stars out of five. I mean if you have to see it go see it because your little kid might want to see it or something, or your little brother or sister. But overall it's just really not worth seeing. I mean you could definitely take them to see something else.  If they're enthusiastic about seeing it take them because, I mean, maybe they might like it but you will have to sit through something that's really you're just like "I do not want to be here". So I mean if you if you (stutter) have to, go see it. But I mean, it's called Nim's Island, I'm giving it two stars.	4.69
Hey, expo tv, this is Aubs eighty four and tonight I'm going to give a review of the movie A Four Letter Word, which is currently in theaters. (uhh) This is a more independent film, so many of you won't be able to find it at your major theaters. If you have an independent or unaffiliated theater near you, this is where you're going to find this movie.  It it's (stutter) a gay movie. It follows the story of a two gay gentlemen who end up (uhh) hooking up and trying to make a relationship work. It starts out where one of the guys is kinda macho man. He's (uhh) he's (stutter) all about the guys. He sleeps around a lot. He's never been tied down. He's afraid of commitment. He's just out to have a good time. And he's got a lot of (uhh), you know, friends with him who kinda do much of the same. However, one time he goes into a bar and he meets this guy, and his name is Stephen, who is exact opposite. He's, you know, all about lovey-dovey, commitment, relationship and the two end up falling in love together.  (umm) The story is mostly about how they try to deal with being in a monogamous relationship (uhh) when the one guy kinda isn't very used to that. It deals with a lot of homosexual issues (umm) in terms of acceptance and they try to deal with love in their own way and how the mainstream doesn't really accept that a lot of times.  (umm) While while (stutter) the homosexual aspect is kind of brought up in this movie, and it it (stutter) is influenced (umm) by the mainstream, most of the movie focuses just on the two guys' relationship and how they try to make it work. It it (stutter) pretends as though it's just a normal couple who are doing a normal thing and never mind that they're homosexual, they're just out trying to (umm), you know, have a loving relationship and go on.  I think that's kind of refreshing actually because (uhh) I found (uhh) a lot of the homosexual movies focus too much on, you know, the idea that they're being persecuted or that it's so hard to be gay in today's society or, you know, they're always looked down upon and they struggle through life. And this movie, while it kind of hints at that a little bit, it's definitely not its main focus and it it's (stutter) barely touched upon, actually.  There is a lot of profanity in this movie, (umm) so if you're worried about that I wouldn't see it. (uhh) Not a lot of overtly sexual content. (umm) Obviously, you're going to see a bunch of good looking guys in in various states of undress, but not any, you know, graphic sexual depictions, or anything like that.  (umm) There is a little bit of race issue in this, too, because one of the guys is white and one of the guys is a minority. So it's interesting to see not only are they gay and struggling to deal with that, with each other, they're also (uhh), you know, the race issue comes into play a couple of times, as well. So there's kind of a lot of dynamics going on here. (umm) One one (stutter) of the main things I didn't like about the movie is that the two main actors aren't very good. I don't think they get into their roles enough. (uhh) They're homosexual in real life and so that aids them in playing gay men, but I don't think they embody their characters well enough. They don't make you feel like they're actually who they say they are.  (umm) If you've been left feeling empty by other movies before, you know what that feels like when a character doesn't sell it right you kinda, you know, you're left hallow. You're left like, "Well I paid good money for this. Why aren't they going to, you know, work hard for me?" And I think you'll get that a lot in this movie. A supporting cast, I would say is equal to that or even worse. (uhh) Some scenes, I've see, I mean guys looking off just kinda bored and like they're not even wanting to be part of this movie. And I, if you've seen a lot of movies, you kinda know what that looks like and you can kinda pick up on that. (uhh) Maybe if you haven't seen as many movies, you won't notice some of the supporting actors being bored. But you will notice the main actors just kinda not flowing very well together.  (uhh) I haven't seen any other movies with either of them in it, so I don't know what they're normally like. I don't know th if this is, you know, how they are in all their movies, or if they just weren't into this movie.  And the two main actors (uhh) actually were writers of this movie as well, so it makes me think, that it's not that they weren't into the movie, it's just kinda how they act. Which is kinda disappointing. I would have liked to see it with a more well known lead actor, (umm) who really wanted to get into the role. I'm only going to give this a one of five star. Don't worry about seeing this in theater. Rent this one. There's nothing that you're going to miss. (uhh) And you're gonna save a few bucks, as well. (umm) If you don't like gay movies, if you don't like the homosexual issue, obviously, this isn't gonna be a movie for you. (umm) But if you don't mind that kind of thing, and you're into a little light discussion about how, you know, a gay couple tries to make things work, you might be mildly entertained. (uhh) One out of five stars.	5.745
Hi guys. (umm) Today I'll be reviewing the movie  The Happening. (umm) This movie just released this week and it's been directed by M. Night Shyamalan and written by M. Night Shyamalan. And so most of you know M. Night Shyamalan he's famous for some movie like (umm) the one of the great escape, (umm) Sixth Sense. (umm) But he also made some movies like the Lady In Water. So I, so in my mind it cause kind of mixed feeling like whether it's gonna be like (umm) The Sign or it's gonna be like The Happening. (umm) So xxx I just, I went to the theater to watch this movie and let me firstly tell you it's not that good movie.  If I were rate Sixth Sense as a ten out of ten I would give this movie just like two out of ten. Because (umm) in all the movie you are just like (umm)   they they're (stutter) gonna open suspense, they're gonna open the suspense now, now, now but. (umm) To a standard movie for still like a misleading (umm) a storyline. So in this movie (umm) the main leading character a science teacher played by Eric Moore (umm) the character Erik Moore is being playing by Mark Wahlberg. And he is the main leading character. (umm)  In this movie he is shown as a science teacher and to his point of the (stutter) amusement that (umm)  he found that something strange is happening all around the northeast (umm) coast of the country. (umm) So they they (stutter) cannot figure out what's actually happening. (umm) So in the movie you see like (umm) something return two or three and depressing xxx say totally sharp so if you are taking your children be careful because there are gonna be some scenes which could be like, so many people dead lying on the street or hanging on the tree. So that's a little scary and you don't you don't (stutter) want your children to look at those (umm) scenes. So warning for that.  (umm) So this movie (umm) like, I do not want to disclose the suspense but there is a bit of suspense in this movie (umm) that this, only this guy was saved just from the whole northeast coast just so the guy was like. and then  after sometime like xxx show up that this guy's letting his (umm) regular life and then the same thing happens some other place. (umm) That's that's (stutter) the point where the movie ends. So in this movie (umm)  I would just say that (umm) probably gonna give this movie like a two out of five.  Because the movie (umm) yeah, the most important thing I wanna share about this is that the starting of the movie, it just happened like real fun that something is happening, something is happening it's not like you set a bag down and then start on the storyline. So and in the first scene they have shown that something is happening to the city. And so that scene is continued to the end of the movie. So as I say I'm gonna give this movie two out of five. And again a review for the movie The Happening.	2.708
Hello, my name is Mike, and today I'll be talking to you about the movie The Love Guru starring Mike Myers. As formality here's my movie ticket,  and there we go.  So, what'd I think about this movie?  Mike Myers is usually pretty funny.  I mean (uhh) Austin Powers was pretty hilarious, almost all of them were.  (uhh) Wayne's World was funny. Love Guru not so much. I mean it's not that Love Guru doesn't have at least a few funny jokes. It's just primarily that most of the movie is really crude and,  you know, for a guy that usually does humor that's a little better than this, I mean it can be slapstick and silly, but not usually quite this level of just crude stupidness.  Makes you wonder what he's thinking when he decided to make this movie.  You know I always thought that Austin Powers was pretty juvenile, but in reality it was actually a fairly good level  of intellect. Sort of a James Bondy joke, you know? And you really only realize this after watching this movie when you go "Oh. It could have been a lot stupider". Which is exactly what this movie is, it's stupid. It's about a guy,  India,  wants to learn to be, you know, a guru so girls will like him. You know, it's even the line that he uses in the preview. So,  you know, he becomes this guru and sort of this idea of like ahh it's the horny, chastised love guru.  He's kind of a dork and  the stuff he says is just sort of ridiculous most of the time, and the advice he gives is horrible and sorta questions whether or not it's any good at all.  In reality I really feel this movie is like, yeah, (umm) it's about on par with some of the stupid Saturday Night Live sketches. You know, not even the good ones, but about the stupid ones. Which, you know, are best tolerated for about two minutes. So a full length movie is really hard to pull off with this premise,  you know? The premise itself might have been good, might have been workable, but this is definitely not a workable version of it. So I'm going to give The Love Guru a one out of five. (umm)  Rent it maybe? See it at a super budget price maybe? But (uhh) it's questionable whether or not you should even do that. So Love Guru one out of five for being a very crude, very juvenile adaptation of a not so great premise. Thank you and goodnight.	5.745
HI, I'm reviewing Azumi. This movie was amazing. Filled with action, and there was passion in it, it was great. Basically it it's (stutter) set in feudal Japan where ten homeless children are taken care of by an elderly man and they are trained to be assassins. However their first  (umm) their first  mission was to have to kill their  (umm) other parts of their clan, to see who was worthy of being assassins. Because then those other five are being sent out to kill three main people who are causing trouble in the world. There's a lot of action and the main character, she's amazing. She's a great fighter and this is definitely a movie that should be watched. It's in Japanese and in English and also has the option of having subtitles. So definitely Azumi would be a great movie to get.	5.802
What's up expo tv. I have a movie review for Superhero Movie. (uhh) Currently in theaters.   It's about ninety minutes long and it's rated PG-thirteen for (uhh)   crude and sexual content, comic violence, drug references, language.   (uhh) It's from the makers of Scary Movie but this one's rated PG-thirteen. (uhh) I guess so more people can see it. It it's (stutter) not as good as the original Scary Movie, and it's not as good as pretty much any spoof movie. I thought it was kind of bad. (uhh) I guess the movie's about how  (uhh) how this kid named Rick gets bitten by this dragonfly and and (stutter) he becomes known as, like the dragonfly because he gets all these like, superpowers like he gets I guess like, he gets really strong, his skin gets like tough. And (uhh) it's just like I guess like (stutter) spoof on spiderman and pretty much every other superhero (stutter) movie that's currently out. (uhh) He goes off and fights crime against like this guy called  the hourglass. (uhh) Not that good of a movie as I said. It could have been a lot better. (uhh) It's like one of the most stupid comedies, like you don't really laugh that much, but, but (stutter) you laugh at some parts but as soon as it ends you're like, I just wasted like, ninety minutes of my life and like like (stutter) ten dollars. (uhh) So  I really don't recommend seeing it. Don't see it in the theaters. Do not see it on dvd. (uhh) Just completely ignore like  this movie. I don't get how these movies get put in like like (stutter) theaters, or like production even. Like who wants to do this. So (uhh) Superhero Movie, I would definitely give it a one out of five and I say stay away from this movie.	3.559
I watched You Don't Mess With the Zohan, starring Adam Sandler. And it's about Zohan, and he's an Israeli counterterrorist and he wants to become a hair stylist  and he moves to, I believe it was New York, to fulfill his dream of becoming a stylist. And I went into this movie thinking "man, this is going to be so awful". I was actually really mad at myself that I had to pay  for the price of the ticket cause I did not expect much. And my beliefs were true. It wasn't amazing. It was better than I thought, it was funny, but I definitely would not purchase the movie or want to see it again  and it was a movie that had so many dirty jokes that would appeal to mostly thirteen year old boys,  not to adults or. It was just kind of, it was a really stupid movie. If you like Adam Sandler you probably will like it cause most of his movies are,  are like that. But if you don't like those kind of movies then {noise} I wouldn't see it. (umm) The movie didn't have too much substance, it was basically summarized with the he wants to be a hair stylist. That's what it was about. He was a hair stylist and he did people's hair and that's basically  the whole movie. Put in, like, five hundred dirty jokes in there and then you've got it, that's that's (stutter) the movie alright. So if you're a thirteen year old boy I would go see this, or if you like Adam Sandler you should probably watch You Don't Mess With the Zohan.	4.082
Hi Expo Tv today I will be reviewing the movie The Love Guru. (uhh) This movie is being directed by Marco Schnabel and written by Mike Myers himself and Frank Gory.  (uhh)  As you know, this (uhh)  at the main time Mike Myers who you think of a comedy (umm) like Wayne's World (uhh) so you would expect to be, you would expect this to be hilarious but (uhh) in my expectation I was literally was kind of lost. (uhh) Am I really watching Mike Myer's movie? (uhh) thing is (uhh) That you (uhh)  Mike Myers is known for his different type of comedy style (uhh) but this movie  (uhh) like totally bizarre means you you (stutter) don't really understand some jokes which you are supposed to laugh but it's it's (stutter) pathetic. (uhh) In this movie you also see Jessica Alba, Justin Timberlake and (stutter) Verne Troyer. (uhh)  So the movie starts with (uhh) Mike Myers who (stutter) is playing the role of xxx and he's known as a love guru because (uhh) he help people to make their lives good. (uhh) So he, he (stutter) got kind of (uhh) job that he has to fix (uhh)  the life of a hockey player (uhh) (uhh)  to win the Stanley cup but (uhh) the way he do this stuff (uhh) like he has some goals in his mind that he has to tease that player to win (uhh) to work on, to all come all this difficulties. But (uhh) it really turns out to be rather dull. I I (stutter) just didn't like this movie. (uhh) Good a bitch. (uhh) Only thing I like about this movie was Jessica Alba she doesn't have (uhh) another big role just a short role. She was looking cute also. (uhh) In all I'm gonna give this movie like (uhh) maybe one out of five.  Again (uhh) my name is xxx and I have given a review for The Love Guru.	4.082
I just returned from the movies.  If you want to waste your time go see one called The Love Guru. That's G U R U. Guru, okay? Has Ben Kingsley in it. It's got Mike Myers, he's the, the (stutter) main character. (uhh) Jessica Alba, Justin Timberlake, Jessica Simson. Simpson. It's got a few others in there (uhh) that you will probably have heard about and usually when a movie has a lot of different people in it  that you know about it's usually not gonna be very good and this one wasn't. Mike Myers is absolutely awful. He (stutter) co-wrote this movie from what I understand and it's just, it's just absolutely horrid. The best thing about the movie was that it's only eighty-seven minutes long so you don't have to endure too much.  It's supposed to be a comedy but you'll go in there and you'll be waiting to laugh  but you never will, and then it'll be time to go. So I wouldn't recommend this movie at all. I'd say (stutter) there's much more movies out there that are (uhh) so much more better than this. So  that's my opinion.	5.354
Hello I want to talk to you about Iron Man. This is a great movie based on the Marvel Comics hero Iron Man. And the main character is played by Robert Downey Junior. Now if you know anything about the comic you know that Tony Stark is an eccentric billionaire, he's a weapons designer. He's had a history of (uhh) kind of a substance abuse problems. He's a little bit a smart alec and got a great sense of humor. And really I can't think of anyone else who could have played him better than Robert Downey Junior. Now that I've described Tony Stark then you may have seen several similarities with Robert Downey Junior, such as the history of the (uhh) substance abuse, plus he's a very charming guy and it worked really well (uhh) in this movie. (uhh) The basic plot is that (uhh) Tony Stark is (uhh) developing a new weapon, goes to the Middle East to kind of show it off, and he gets kidnapped by terrorists. (uhh) Things happen (uhh) while he's captured, he escapes through his own ingenuity, and he kind of has to rethink his life and decide where he wants to go from there. And he does the logical step and becomes a superhero. But I think that this is a great movie, it's a lot deeper than a lot of the other superhero movies that are out there, but there's a lot of humor in it as well. This is got a lot of little things in there that if you're a comic book fan you're really gonna notice, look for Captain America's shield in the background in one of the scenes. I looked for a cameo of Stan Lee, but just a lot of fun things in there. You really need to see this movie of course (uhh) it's got a great supporting cast as well, there's Jim Rodingrolls and Pepper Potts and all the comic book characters are in the movie. And they're all played very well, so I really think you need to see this movie. And even if you're not a comic book fan, you're just gonna love this movie as an action movie. It has a little bit of a depth to it.	6.683
Hello everybody, my name is Mike, and today I'll be talking to you about the movie Curse of the Dragon Emperor. As formality, here is my movie ticket.  Here it is again, and this time in slo-mo. mommy vision whoo. Alright so the movie is called Curse of the Dragon Emperor.  (uhh) That's not what it should be called. It should be called, why do you keep making this series.  The first one was alright, I will admit that. It was actually a fairly good movie.  And from that point on they've all been sort of been downhill. With this one probably being the worst one.  This is probably gonna go down as one of the dumbest movies ever made.  So basic premise, (umm)  in the distant past a few thousand years ago.  Chinese Emperor was imprisoned in a sort of suspended animation cryogenic state. Except for without freezing.  And, so him and his army are disguised as the Terracotta Army and the guy from the first previous movies are (umm) accidentally wakes him up and now that guy's gonna try to take over the world. Yeah, so number one, there's no mummy, technically.  (uhh) Number two, that's not that clever of a plot.  You know, it's it's (stutter) sort of clever, you're like, oh well, I can take like vaguely historical things and sort of thread it together to be something (umm) junky. But that's really all that is. It's not that great, cause really even in the end, it's just a vague rehashing of the previous ones. So the story itself is not done very well. It just,  they didn't add anything new to it for me at a previous incarnations, besides the old, let's just set it in a different location. And it's not in Egypt anymore now, it's in China. It's still the same thing. No one does a very good job on their acting. Not a single actor whatsoever.  So, dialogue is bad. I haven't mentioned that yet, but I am right now. Dialogue's bad, acting's bad, the story's bad.  And (umm) so yeah, this series needs to stop. It's not worth seeing. I, this isn't worth seeing. It's not worth renting. It's not even worth seeing at your friends house, for free.  It's stupid. Let it die. Don't go see it. At least that might convince people, hey we should stop making these movies and maybe make something new for once. So this has been Mike, saying hey, it's not good, don't see it. One out of five, boohoo. I'm going away now. Thank you and goodnight.	6.351
College. Starring, who cares? Written by, it doesn't matter. It doesn't even matter anymore because this movie is absolutely terrible. It is like this movie reminds me is is stutter almost exactly like  the American Pie Band Camp, the American Pie Naked Mile except ten times worse and the fact it's in theaters and not straight to DVD or straight to the trash. Really, if you pay money to go see this movie I don't even know anymore. In the trailer they compare this movie to like, you know, Animal House and American Pie how they were for teen comedies. This movie has absolutely no comedy compared to that, it obviously they're trying to go for young audiences, young adults because they're going to have sexuality in it, of course they do. They're going to have, you know, language, nudity, and  drinking, drugs and all that stuff cause it's, you know, college, whatever. This movie is not funny folks, start to end. The story line you don't care about anything. I absolutely hate this movie. I can't even describe.  Not only should of it went straight to DVD, if that, it shouldn't have been made, it shouldn't even have been thought of, okay? Really, it is that bad. It is, like, what I can compare it to is a straight to DVD American Pie Presents, that's what it's trying to be.  And it is not funny or anything like the American Pie series or Animal House or, you know, Revenge of the Nerds like it do in the trailer. The story line is about these freshmen who, or is about to be freshmen, seniors in high school and they're going to freshman orientation, okay?  And they meet up (stutter) you know frat boys and all this and they become friends with them and they meet up with sorority girls and all this and then sexuality flies and then oh they get, you know, in trouble with the frat boys cause, you know, conflicts arise with the girls. It is absolutely terrible. And not only is the story line terrible, the comedy is not funny, get this through your heads. It is not funny, okay? This movie is aimed at young adults who really have nothing better to do with their money. Please go see another movie or do not see this movie at all. Please, please, I am begging you. Do not see this movie.  So if you think it's going to be anything what college is like  it is no. Just because, you know,  there, you know, there's there's (stutter) drinking in college does not mean anything that's something happens in all of them, this is completely so cliche and such one of those college movies that just, you know, exaggerates everything a hundred-million times. Really, it's an exaggeration of everything. So please, don't go to see this movie, it's not funny. Seriously, that's all I got to say. Giving it a one out of five.	5.354
Hey Expo TV. Today I'm here to talk about the movie in theaters Death Race.  (umm) Jason Statham plays the main character in this film. (umm) This is probably one of the worst summer films I've seen so far.  (umm) That will remain on that list since summer's almost over. (umm) Basically the premise for the film is that the American (umm) penal system is becoming over flooded with too many prisoners.  (umm) So what happens basically, the prison system becomes privatized and this company, Waylan Corporation, sees an opportunity to make an extreme sport out of the prison over population.  (umm) So it's completely ridiculous. What happens basically is this extreme sport is the death race. (umm) It's more or less a modernization of Roman gladiators. (umm) The person who wins, the prisoner who wins will get his freedom  and basically everyone else dies trying (umm) is essentially what the game is. Armored cars, machine guns,  basically any way you can get through the race course, (uhh) surviving and taking out (umm) as many as your of your opponents as you possibly can, is how this game works.  (umm) The acting itself I felt was actually quite good. Jason Statham does a fantastic job. (umm)  But, just bad plot really is what killed this movie for me.  Special effects like the car crashes, explosions, gunfire, all that kind of stuff. (umm) That was done quite well I thought, strangely enough. (umm) But like I said the plot is really what pulled this movie down. (umm) Definitely appeals to the young male crowd.  (umm) You have car chases, explosions, gunfights, (umm) and girls all in the same movie. So  (umm) definitely aiming towards the younger crowd there. (umm) I was not impressed though however. I would give this one out of five stars. Not worth your time or your money. Thumbs down.	5.686
Hello. I'd like to tell you about a movie that a friend took me to see and I didn't really like that much. The movie is called Quarantine and the the (stutter) general plot is it's kind of a,  you know, a horror flick. (uhh) People traveling are trapped in a hotel that's been quarantined for an unknown reason and they're slowly getting, you know, picked off one at a time. Now that plot may sound familiar, I know I've seen it in a dozen other movies and frankly (uhh) none of them are that good. There's just not enough to work with there, I mean,  sounds like a good place to build up some tension but they really didn't do a job in this movie. It doesn't star anybody that I've ever heard of and  I just think it was done very, very poorly. You know, you almost can tell anybody goes outside or comes up with a great idea or something that something bad is going to happen to them immediately, it's pretty obvious, and when it's obvious it's not scary. You can pretend (uhh)  to scream and, you know, yell at the screen with your friends but really you all know what's going to, to (stutter) happen so xxx is the kind of movie you go to make fun of with your friends but I don't really want to pay, you know, eight bucks to do that so if you are interested in this film I'd definitely wait for it to come out on video and (uhh) I really don't think that you're gonna get much out of it except for maybe a laugh, but definitely not a scare.	4.359
Hey guys, my name's Adam Lunsford and the product I'm talking about today is the DVD  The Bourne Supremacy starring Matt Damon. This is a really great movie. Hopefully you've been able to get into theaters and check out the newest one the last movie in this series, The Bourne Ultimatum which I absolutely loved. But this movie is the movie that started it all. It's really really good and just like the Bourne Ultimatum, nonstop action. Just like the other two the plot is super intense it will keep you on the edge of your seat. The fight scenes, the chase scenes, all the scenes in this movie are just awesome I love it. It's probably my favorite movie in this series. I really, really like it it kind of sets the foundation for the other two. It's a really good movie, if you haven't seen it, you don't have it it's a must have you gotta check this movie out. It's a great one to add to the collection and it's essential if you're gonna get the other two. I love this movie, one of my favorite action movies of all time, Matt Damon does an awesome job, it's just nonstop, action-packed really really really cool movie. Check it out, The Bourne Supremacy starring Matt Damon.	6.403
The Haunting of Molly Hartley  Where are movies going these days? I don't, I don't (stutter) even know.  Do not pay to see this movie. Do not rent this movie on DVD. Do not watch this movie for free and do not even think that this movie was made, just pretend like it never even existed okay? Cause it is that bad, and like, I promise you it is that bad, I promise you.  The plot goes nowhere.  But not only that, there's no scares. So if you (stutter) think you're gonna see a scary movie, you're not. There's no scares, and if there are, they've been done before and they're predictable. You know they're coming, because they've been done before.  There's no plot. It goes nowhere. You don't care and then by the time the ending comes around you think, that's it? That's seriously the ending?  And you like, you really question  if they even continued (stutter), if they even finished filming or if they were just like, let's just rap it up and put a movie together and send it out. I mean you really contemplate that. Do not see this movie. (umm) There's one good thing about this movie and it's really not even that great is that some of the actors and actresses, you know, they're pretty good looking. But not even that much, I mean, it's just a cliche Hollywood thing. You can just tell they hired all these good looking young actors and actresses and put em in there to try to sell the movie to teenagers. And that's it. That's really all I got to say about this movie is do not even think about it,  okay. And I promise you it is that bad.  If you pay full price to see this I I (stutter) really am sorry if you didn't know how bad it was or just anything like that. If you were just like, oh I'll give it a chance, I really, I'm I'm (stutter) sorry. I really am sorry. Because this movie goes nowhere. The Haunting, you think it's gonna be like the Exorcism or something, it's not. It is so dumb  she's basically haunted by the devil or something  because her mom stabbed her or something. I'm not even gonna tell you. Just, it's dumb. Don't go see it. That's it. That's all I gotta say about it. Don't go see it. I'm gonna give this one out of five. Gosh, it was a  waste. I'm more mad that I waste life, really. A waste of life.	5.745
Hi expo. Today I'd like to do a movie review for you of a movie that's currently in theaters and that is The Boy in Striped Pajamas. (umm) The Boy In Striped Pajamas is a movie that (umm) is about  (umm) World War Two and the holocaust and it's about a young boy whose father is the herr commandant of a concentration camp and they actually move (umm) him and his family move close to the concentration camp. (umm) Not close enough that they can see everything but pretty close. (umm)  And the young boy, the German boy, (uhh) starts exploring in the woods and actually stumbles upon the concentration camp and he meets a young Jewish boy who is a prisoner of the camp (umm) inside of the concentration camp from the other side of the barbed wire fence. (umm) And they start forming a relationship that is kept secret from (umm) everybody that they, they (stutter) know. (umm) And this movie really just explores (umm) their relationship and the culture of the family (umm) and it's a really good film because it touches on a (umm) really sort of innocent relationship that's taking place and (umm) it touches upon the holocaust in a different way than you've (umm) seen it probably portrayed before. This movie is (umm) unimaginably sad, (umm) but it's also unimaginably touching, which I think, you know, is kind of typical of most holocaust movies. (umm) It does a really good job, there is no (umm)  there's no like  nudity, no (umm) profanity and things of this nature so it is appropriate for (umm) older children who are starting to learn about the holocaust and things like that. Of course it's a topic that you always want to be cautious with in how you present it but it's a part of history that we all need to know about and this film did a really good job of (umm) portraying that. (umm) The scenery was beautiful, the cinematography was beautiful, and all the actors did a really wonderful job in their roles. It was definitely a movie I think everybody out there should go check out. Again (umm) it's The Boy in Striped Pajamas and you should definitely check it out.	3.464
Hey, everyone on ExpoTV dot com. Now, today I'm going to be reviewing another movies in theaters called The Haunting in Connecticut. Now (umm) this is sort of, if you've ever seen the movie Poltergeist, then (uhh) this movie is pretty similar to that. It's basically this kid is being treated for cancer, so they relocate their house. And the house that (uhh) they move into has a dark history behind it basically.  And, you know, all this weird stuff goes on. And then they basically try to get help from a ghost hunter to drive, like, the evil spirits out of their house. (umm) Anyway, I didn't really find this movie (uhh) that good. It had some creepy moments, but I was expecting a lot more from the trailer. You see a lot more and it kind of freaks you out and wants you to go see it. But, you know, nothing really special. I didn't really catch onto anything.  It was a pretty plain movie anyway {yawn} but, you know, maybe maybe (stutter) (uhh) there will be other ones that come out. But this is not a good horror movie, I don't think, at least. I might be wrong. You can go check at, check it out and maybe prove me wrong. I don't really know. I can't really think of anything that was that good about it. It was okay. I mean, it was entertaining to watch, but nothing really had you thinking it really, nothing special. But I give this movie a  two out of five.	3.83
Hey y'all. It's the king of movies here and today I'm going to review Dragonball: Evolution. Now this is a new movie. It's a live-action and it's based off of Akira Toriyama's manga and anime (umm) that's incredibly popular. You might have seen the anime on Cartoon Network. (uhh) This movie is a lot different than that though and I think that was a bad thing overall. The movie lacks a charm that we've seen in the cartoon and the comics.  (umm) There's some bad martial arts, the effects are bad, there's overdubbing, which is terrible. (umm) The movie just overall has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. (uhh) The only thing that you can really do with this movie is just laugh at how bad it is, especially if you're a fan of the original works. (uhh) You're either gonna wanna stay away from this cause it cause it (stutter) might ruin your view of the Dragonball universe or (uhh) just (uhh) be willing to laugh at it and which you might get some entertainment out of it but that doesn't make it a good movie.  So, besides (umm) the bad martial arts and stuff like that, this movie is, it's possible that some kids might enjoy it. But for anyone older than ten I think that you'd wanna stay away. There's tons of plot holes and the movie just doesn't take itself seriously or it it (stutter) tries to but it just fails and (uhh) we're just left with a movie that really just has no backbone or any point. That's my review of Dragonball: Evolution. Stay away.	3.697
Hi there, I'm Alexis and I'm doing a review on My Sister's Keeper. This movie is playing out in theaters and it is very good. I would give it a five star rating. And  (umm) basically the movie is PG-thirteen it's one hour and forty-six minutes. (umm)  There are very good actresses and actors in this movie. And I was very impressed with the film. (uhh) There's Abigail Breslin, Cameron Diaz, Sofia Vassilieva and Jason Patrick. And they all play very, very good. (umm)  I was just really impressed with this movie and I recommend it to many people. One thing that I should warn you about is the movie will probably make you cry throughout the whole film. Because it's about this little girl who is dying from leukemia  and there are just (umm)  the family, it (umm) is just getting torn apart. And there's just a lot of the drama going on and (umm)  it's a wonderful storyline, really really interesting and (umm) it will just keep you on the edge of your seat the whole movie. It's very, very good and I am so impressed with how it turned out. There's also a bestselling book called My Sister's Keeper and that's why they have the movie and (umm)  it's just so good, so. Go watch it, I mean I just want everyone to see it because it's just so serious you can see how (umm)  you can watch a girl, a little kid going through leukemia and it's just so sad but. I mean, it just shows you right there and.  I mean that stuff really gets to you and it was pretty serious, so (umm)  I think that many people should see it so that you can see how serious leukemia is and how much it affects the family. And all that, so  yeah. It just, it opened my eyes to life and like opened my eyes to a different view on life and I know that it would open many views to other peoples and people. (umm)  Different perspectives on things so (umm) it's definitely worth watching.	5.26
Hey expo tv, today I'm gonna review for you the movie Jennifer's Body. Which is a movie that's currently in theaters. (uhh) This movie is rated R, there's some graphic violence and (umm) (uhh)  cursing in this movie so that's why it's rated R. (umm) I loved this movie. I thought this was a great movie. It stars Megan Fox, Adam Brody and Amanda Seyfried. (umm) Those are the three leads in the movie. And I don't want to give too much away about it but it's about Megan Fox's character is Jennifer and she gets possessed (umm) by a demon and I won't tell you how because you find that out in the movie and it's really funny. (umm) And she basically has to kill people to stay healthy. (umm) As this demon and to keep you know, keep feeding on boys basically is what she decides to do in order to keep herself healthy. (umm) Amanda Seyfried plays her best friend Anita, (umm) who you find out in the very beginning of the movie is in a mental institution and you see why through the course of the movie what happened. (uhh) Adam Brody plays the lead singer of this indie band. (umm) And he has something to do with why Jennifer becomes possessed by this demon. (umm) It's really funny, it's a dark comedy. There is, it is pretty scary there's some (stutter) suspenseful parts to this movie that I wasn't expecting so it was scary. (umm) And it is, you do kind of have to get over the fake teenage dialogue that's in this movie. It's by the same person who wrote Juno so there's a lot of that you know, type of dialogue going on. (umm) It's silly but you know, you you (stutter) forget about it when you're watching the movie. I loved this movie this is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.	7.0
So this is a movie review on Salt, starring Angelina Jolie. (umm) {cough}   First of all, I have to say that I was very, very excited to see this movie. (umm) Ever since I'd seen the previews I just really wanted to see it. And  I wasn't disappointed at all. (umm) I went to see it with a good friend of mine, and the preview leads you to believe that the movie is about  just Angelina or Salt being (uhh)  being chased and accused of being a accused of being a (stutter) Russian spy, but it's really a lot more to the movie than just that. I don't want to spoil the movie for you in case you haven't seen it. But let me just tell you there are so many unexpected twists to this plot. (umm) I think Angelina does an exceptional job portraying Salt. (umm) Her emotion is shown so well,  and all the actors do, do (stutter) an amazing job really.  My only problem with this movie was  the ending was a bit unsatisfying to me because I wanted to see what was going to happen next. But  I mean it was a great movie, it's definitely worth seeing. (umm)  I'm definitely going to buy this movie and watch it again and show it to other people it was just that good. (umm) I'm a big Angelina Jolie fan and she definitely did not disappoint with this one.	4.359
Hello, I'd like to tell you that you should go see Captain America. It's really a great movie. It stars Chris Evans and  he is an unknown until this movie. I think he did a really good job. Since I had seen some of the older Captain America movies I thought it maybe it would just be too cheesy and too childlike and so I was going in with prejudice. So I was very happily surprised to find out that this guy can really act like a superhero and he can get away with it. The the (stutter) plot for Captain America is this young guy with not too much muscle and we don't know yet if he has a very good, you know, a very good mind. (umm) He tries to join the army repeatedly and never gets in for one reason or another, usually because he's just too scrawny. And then a scientist recognizes his potential, in not only his body potential because he he (stutter) thinks well maybe I can put him in this super army and develop him and also use his mind because he sees that (uhh) this guy is really, really intelligent. So basically he becomes a one man army. He is not taught that he is the only one, so he practices and builds and builds and builds and his mind does develop and his body develops as well. It's very convincing and the (uhh) effects of the movie are very good, the color is excellent, and really I think it's an overall really good job. So I'm going to give this one a thumbs up, go see Captain America.	5.0
I am going to talk to you today about The Lion King.  I took, my husband and I took the kids to see The Lion King. (umm) We had seen it originally (umm) when we were very young and, well I guess not so young. But (umm)  I hadn't seen it since I was a teenager and the kids were really asking to see it cause of the promotions they were giving on TV so we decided to go ahead and take them to see the movie. Well, I must say that the movie is better than I remembered it. It's about the lions and the different animals in the prideland.  And Simba, who is the King's son (umm) is forced to step up to be the king before he's ready. He ends up running away and the pridelands are nearly destroyed and he comes back to defend his family's honor and to restore the pridelands and serve as king. (umm) It has great music in it. They really remastered the color is wonderful. (umm) The kids so loved it and I loved it for them because I think it gave them  a lot of like, good life lessons about love and responsibility and overall I was very very very pleased with the movie. The kids really enjoyed it and I thought it was a good time. A good nice family movie. So I really do recommend if you haven't seen it yet, The Lion King. (umm) It has great, a great story to it plus it has good music. It's animated so it really keeps the kids entertained but it does have a good moral to the story. So I recommend The Lion King.	4.509

It's a Bollywood Hindi movie, so it contains Akshay Kumar and John Abraham, two great Bollywood actors that are rising, especially Akshay Kumar who has been around in Bollywood.  It's a really great funny movie. It has a great story line. It's overall one of the best like one of the great Bollywood movie. I wouldn't say the best but it's up there where people can have a good family enjoyment. It's not, it's not (stutter) even too like, based of of age or teenagers or anything so a lot of people will watch it. (uhh) My parents watched it too and they enjoyed it. Any age could, young and old, there's nothing explicit or anything there. (uhh) There's also another great actor at the top here. He's really funny, he makes a lot of jokes throughout the whole movie and then, the overall theme and the story line of it is just great. So this movie's made by Venus records or Venus group. (umm) Another thing about this movie, it has a cool case, as you can tell. You can take it off, it's a cover. Then you open up another and you have, other guide. It's just like, it gives like a cool brief thing. It has a cool pull out just to see the actresses in the movie and here's another one and then it just finally gets the DVD.  Where it's a two-pack combo. One is just with features and things at the end.  (umm) Another great part about this movie is that it just, it's Bollywood is a rising industry and then this is one of the great films that came out of it. Thank you.	5.354
